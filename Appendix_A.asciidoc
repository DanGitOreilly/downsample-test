== Essential Electronics and AC Circuits

This appendix presents brief overviews of specific((("electronics", "basic electonics theory, topics in"))) topics in basic electronics theory,
beyond the discussion presented in <<Chapter_1>>. It is intended for anyone who might be interested
in exploring some of the theory behind electronics, or who perhaps might benefit
from it for personal projects. Topics covered include voltage, current, power, series and
parallel circuits, Thévenin circuit analysis, capacitance, and
impedance. A terse overview of basic pass:[<span class="keep-together">solid-state</span>] theory is included to introduce the
concepts of semiconductors and their applications.

<<Appendix_B>> contains a set of basic electronic schematic symbols. If you
encounter something here that you don't recognize, be sure to look there.
If you need more information than what is contained here, then you might want
to look into the texts listed in <<Appendix_D>>.

The main emphasis throughout this appendix is on the fundamental concepts, rather
than the details. With a good grasp of the fundamentals, you'll find the more detailed
concepts behind modern electronic components and circuits much easier to
comprehend. So think of this appendix as a travel brochure to the land of
electronics. What adventures you decide to have beyond this point are entirely
up to you.

=== Units of Measurement

<<standard_units>> lists some of the most common characteristics that apply to electrical circuits.((("electronics", "basic electonics theory, topics in", "units of measurement")))((("units of measurement"))) These will appear
throughout the rest of this appendix as they are needed, and they are defined in
<<Chapter_1>>, here in the appendix, and in the <<Appendix_C>>.

In <<standard_units>>, the Symbol column gives the nomenclature used
with a definite value: 1V, 2.5A, 1 second, and so on. The Reference column gives
the letter typically used in equations and schematic component references,
as in C1, R10, E = IR, and so on.

In many cases, a fundamental unit of measure is impractical for normal usage, so
it is specified in larger or smaller units through the use of a prefix. <<standard_prefixes>> lists the most
commonly encountered unit prefixes.((("units of measurement", "standard value prefixes")))

|pico   | p      | 1 x 10^-12^ | one trillionth
|=================================================================

Resistance is seldom given in milliohms or smaller, although these can occur when
you're working with precision measurements of low values of resistance in the laboratory.
You will usually see ohms given as kilo ohms, mega ohms, or just ohms, and values
less than 1 ohm are usually given as a decimal value. Capacitance and inductance,
on the other hand, are most often given in micro, milli, nano, or pico units.

=== Voltage, Current, and Power

The two key characteristics of electrical phenomena are voltage and current.
Voltage can be viewed in several ways.((("voltage")))((("electronics", "basic electonics theory, topics in", "voltage, current, and power"))) The most common is to treat it as
being analogous to pressure. Voltage can also be viewed as a type of potential
energy. The third way is to view voltage as the measure of the electromotive
force behind electron movement.((("current"))) Current is analogous to flow volume and is
defined as the number of electrons moving past a particular point in a circuit
in a specific interval of time.

The two concepts are closely related, and it is not always possible to speak of
one without reference to the other. Without voltage, no current can flow, and
without current flow, there is static electrical charge (a voltage), but no
meaningful work can occur.

[NOTE]
====
Refer to <<Chapter_1>> for an overview of electric charge and electron movement.
Many of the terms and concepts used here are defined there, so I won't duplicate
that effort.
====

In a DC circuit, the relationships between voltage, current, and power are
straightforward.((("power", "relationships among voltage, current, and power")))((("DC (direct current)", "relationships among voltage, current, and power in DC circuits")))((("AC (alternating current)", "relationships among voltage, current, and power in AC circuits"))) There are no time, phase, or frequency aspects to worry about,
as in the case with AC circuits. <<sec-AC_concepts>> looks more closely at AC circuits,
but in general, the discussion here about voltage, current,
and power also applies to AC (with some frequency-dependent exceptions,
which are covered in <<sec-ac_components>>). Current is discussed in <<sec-current_def>>,
and power is covered in <<sec-power_def>>.

[[sec-voltage_def]]
==== Voltage

The unit of measure for voltage is the volt, abbreviated as V. In a DC circuit,
voltage can be defined simplistically as the electric potential difference between
two points.

In an electric circuit, energy is put into a system and either does some work, such
as being converted to heat, or is expressed as electical or magnetic fields, as
in the case of AC circuits and reactive components. The main point is that in order
to create the potential gradient, something had to expend some energy in some fashion.
That energy is returned when the potential becomes a voltage drop across a component
and current flows. If the component is a resistor (or even just a wire), it will
be expressed mainly as heat. If it is an inductor, the energy is stored in the
magnetic field that forms around the coils of the inductor (or around a single wire).
A capacitor stores energy in the form of an electric field between two plates.
<<sec-ac_components>> covers inductors and capacitors in more detail.

Another way to view voltage when current is flowing is as the force _pushing_
current flow. The higher the voltage, the more readily it will force current flow
through an impediment such as resistance (or an insulator, if the voltage is
very high). By the same token, as the voltage or current is increased, more energy
will be expended in the process, which is expressed as power, usually in the form
of heat.

The amount of voltage between two points in an electric circuit is dependent on the
voltage source, which itself applies some type of force to produce a current flow.
A generator or dynamo uses((("electromagnetic force (EMF)"))) electromagnetic force (EMF) to produce current flow at
a given voltage. A power supply converts the voltage and current from a common AC
power circuit (for example) into a specific voltage with a particular available
current in either DC or AC form. A battery uses an electrochemical process to
produce the electromotive force to generate a voltage pass:[<span class="keep-together">potential.</span>]

<<voltage_forms>> illustrates the three forms of voltage.((("voltage", "forms of"))) A source of electromotive
force produces a potential voltage. The EMF source might be a battery, a
generator (dynamo), a bimetallic junction, or a solar cell. Whatever it is, it is
a primary source of electrons with some amount of EMF giving them a potential
voltage.((("potential voltage"))) This initial generation of EMF involves the conversion of some form of
energy (chemical, electromechanical, thermal, or photonic) into electrical energy.

[[voltage_forms]]
.Voltage potential and EMF
image::images/pect_aa01.png["DC voltage over time",align="center"]

So long as the potential remains untapped, it will simply be a static potential. It
is described in terms of volts, but not current or power (since it is static, no
electrons are moving). When the potential is converted into current flow in a closed
circuit, then the concepts of current and power come into the picture. The downward-pointing arrow in <<voltage_forms>> indicates the drop in potential as current flows,
some work is done, and the potential difference decreases back to zero. The voltage
level shown is arbitrary and is solely for the purpose of illustration.

<<DC_voltage>> shows a graphical ((("voltage", "DC voltage over time")))representation of a DC voltage over time, which is
just a straight horizontal line across the graph. This is what you would expect to
see if you looked at a DC voltage with an oscilloscope. Again, the voltages were
selected for illustration purposes.

[[DC_voltage]]
.DC voltage over time, a straight line
image::images/pect_aa02.png["DC voltage over time",align="center"]

Notice that <<DC_voltage>> shows both positive and negative voltages. The
polarity of a DC voltage is largely dependent on what is used as the neutral (i.e.,
ground) reference; and in some cases, the positive terminal of a power source might
be ground, in which case the voltages measured in the circuit would be negative.
Some types of power supplies have both positive and negative outputs. This is
often the case in PC power supplies, like the one described in <<sec-power_def>>.

It's important to bear in mind one essential fact about voltage: it exists only
relative to two specific points. In other words, voltage is measured relative
to something. When a voltage is measured relative to a common reference point
(e.g., ground), it is a measure of the circuit voltage at that point. It doesn't
really say anything about voltages across individual components, only how the
circuit has affected the voltage at the measurement point (if there has been
any effect at all).

<<voltage_measurement>> illustrates the measurement concept.((("voltage", "measurement in a circuit"))) Assuming that R1 and
R2 are the same value, the voltage at point A will be some fraction of the supply
voltage, which is shown as one-half of the supply voltage in this case. The actual
value of the voltage at point A will depend on the values of R3, R4, and R5. Refer
to <<Chapter_1>> for an introduction to voltage dividers and to <<sec-series_resistance>>,
<<sec-parallel_resistance>>, and <<sec-thevenin>> for a more detailed discussion of
series and parallel resistance networks. The voltage at point B will always be
whatever the supply voltage happens to be, which is 9V in this case.

[[voltage_measurement]]
.Voltage measurement in a circuit
image::images/pect_aa03.png["Voltage measurement in a circuit",align="center"]

The voltage measured across a component is called ((("voltage drops")))the _voltage drop_. <<volt_drop>>
employs the circuit from <<voltage_measurement>> to illustrate this distinction.

[[volt_drop]]
.Voltage drops in a circuit
image::images/pect_aa04.png["Voltage drops in a simple circuit",align="center"]

The voltage measured across R3 (between points A and B) in <<volt_drop>> is the
voltage drop across the resistor, as is the voltage across R1. The measurement
from point A to neutral across R2 is the voltage drop across R2.

[[sec-current_def]]
==== Current

Current flow is one of the two essential features of electricity (the other
being voltage).((("current")))((("electronics", "basic electonics theory, topics in", "current"))) Electrical current is the movement (or _flow_) of electrical
charge through a conducting medium of some sort. Although it is typically
used to refer to electrons as the charge carriers, it can also describe the
flow of charge carried by ions within the electrolyte of a battery, for example.
In principle, anything that carries electrical charge from one point to another
is a form of current flow. It is analogous to the volume of fluid flowing
through a pipe in, say, liters per second, or the number of steel ball bearings
moving past a point in a tube in some specific interval of time (borrowing from
<<Chapter_1>>). pass:[<span class="keep-together">Electrical</span>] charge without current flow is just static charge
and does no work.

Current is measured in amperes, abbreviated as A, and((("amperes (A)")))((("current", "measurement"))) often shortened to _amp_.
The quick and easy definition of current states that one ampere of current can
be defined as 1 coulomb of charge (6.24 &#x00D7; 10^18^ electrons) moving past a given
point in an electric circuit per unit time, although the traditional formal
definition involved the force generated between two conductors spaced some
fixed distance apart in a vacuum. Recently, it has been proposed that the formal
definition adopt the more straightforward definition, wherein 1 ampere is defined
as 6.2415093 &#x00D7; 10^18^ elementary charges (either positive or negative) moving
past a specific point in one second of time. Or, to put it another way:

1 ampere = 1 coulomb per second

[[sec-power_def]]
==== Power

Electrical current is used to perform work of some kind.((("electronics", "basic electonics theory, topics in", "power")))((("power"))) This might be in an
electric motor or a loudspeaker, wherein the current flow and associated
electromagnetic phenomena are converted to mechanical motion. It could also
be in the form of an incandescent lamp, a solid-state circuit (e.g., a radio
or a computer), or an electric arc welder. In each case, the flow of electrons
performs some type of work, with the result typically expressed as heat,
radiant electro-magnetic energy (RF), mechanical motion, or a combination
of all three.

Power is a measure of energy expended as work is performed.((("power", "calculating"))) Electrical
power is simply the product of voltage and current, in that P = EI, where P is
the power, in watts, E is the voltage, and I is the current, in amperes. From
this, you can see that something like an electric arc welder operating at 25V
(with the arc active) at 150A of current will produce 3,750W of power at the
arc, all of which is concentrated into a small area about 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch in
diameter. It's no wonder that it can melt metal.

Conversely, the power supply in a typical vacuum tube (valve) audio amplifier
might produce 500V DC at around 250 mA (milli-amperes). This results in 125W
of available power. So, although the current is low, the high voltage is what
gives the amplifier power to easily produce 25W or more of audio output
to drive the loudspeaker.

Lastly, consider ((("switching-mode power supply (SMPS)", "in a modern PC")))((("power sources", "power supplies", "output specifications for PC power supply")))the switching-mode power supply (SMPS) in a modern PC. The
input voltage and current are 8.5A at 115V RMS, which is 977.5W (<<sec-AC_concepts>> discusses 
RMS). <<pc_supply_specs>> shows the output specifications for a typical
low-cost PC power supply.

[[pc_supply_specs]]
.Output specifications for a typical low-cost PC power supply
[width="100%",cols="^1,^1,^1",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|=================================================
| Output (V) | Current (A) | Power (W)
|    +3.3    | 20          | 66
|    +5      | 20          | 100
|    +12     | 18          | 216
|    +12     | 18          | 216
|    -12     | 0.8         | 9.6
|    +5      | 2.5         | 12.5
|=================================================

The supply is rated for 400W, so that implies that the specifications might
be a bit misleading. If you add up all the output power, we get 620.1W. If you
assume that one of the +12V outputs is simply a duplicate of the other and
subtract 216W, then you get 404.1, which is close to the manufacturer's
stated rating. Notice that there is a significant difference between the input
power and the available output power. Some simple math (output/input &#x00D7; 100)
shows that the supply is approximately 41% efficient. This isn't great, as
a switching-mode power supply can do better than that, but it's acceptable for something
around $40. The real downside here is that the wasted power
(around 573 watts) is going to end up as heat, so the fan in this unit will be
running quite a bit when it's under load.

=== Resistance

In DC circuits, the thing that mediates the relationships((("electronics", "basic electonics theory, topics in", "resistance")))((("resistance"))) between voltage, current,
and power is resistance, or resistivity, and its reciprocal, conductivity. In AC
circuits, capacitance, inductance, and reactance also come into play, and those
are discussed in <<sec-ac_components>>. However, in an AC circuit with no significant
amount of inductance or capacitance, the concepts presented here for DC circuits
will generally apply to root mean square (RMS) values for AC voltages (see
<<sec-AC_concepts>> for the definition of RMS).

[[sec-conductivity]]
==== Conductivity and Resistance

Electrical conductivity is a characteristic of all physical matter.((("conductivity", "and resistance")))((("resistance", "conductivity and"))) The degree of
conductivity ranges from zero (a perfect insulator) to infinity (a perfect
conductor). The actual numeric value of conductivity can range from a very small
number (for an insulator), to a very large value (for a good conductor).

The reciprocal of conductivity is resistance, which is what is normally used
when we are considering the resistivity of a component. For example, a component with a
resistance of 1 ohm has a conductivity of 1, whereas a component with a resistance
of 1,000,000 ohms has a conductivity of 0.000001. A component with a resistance
of 0 has an undefined (infinite) conductivity. From this, it follows that no matter
how good a conventional conductor might be, it will never have infinite conductivity,
and hence it will always have some amount of resistance. The only known exceptions
are superconductors.

In electrical circuits, a resistor is a component((("resistors"))) that is designed to exhibit a
specific resistivity. One way to consider this involves the concept of valence
electrons presented in <<Chapter_1>>. Elements that can easily give and accept
valence electrons tend to be good conductors, and consequently have a relatively low
resistance to current flow. Those elements that have tightly bound electrons tend
to be poor conductors, and hence good insulators. Resistors lie somewhere between
insulators and good conductors and are made from various forms of carbon, high-resistance wire, and vapor-deposited films, among other materials. The material type
and thickness are adjusted to produce the desired resistance value. <<Chapter_8>>
describes the various types of resistors that are pass:[<span class="keep-together">available.</span>]

When current flows through a resistance, work is done to maintain the current flow.
The higher the resistance (and the lower the conductivity), the higher the level of
work necessary to maintain a given current flow. Varying the voltage across the
resistive load will vary the amount of current _pushed_ through the load. The
relationship between voltage, current, and resistance is defined by Ohm's law.

[[sec-ohms_law]]
==== Ohm's Law

We can use the relationship defined ((("resistance", "in Ohm&#x27;s law")))((("Ohm&#x27;s law")))by Ohm's law to help understand how voltage,
current, and resistance interact, and subsequently, how power is related to these
three characteristics as well.

Ohm's law is stated as:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{E = I R}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math1.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{ E = I R}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

where _E_ is the voltage in volts, _I_ is the current in amperes, and _R_ is resistance
in ohms. The use of the symbols _E_ and _I_ is largely a matter of historical legacy.
You can replace them with _V_ and _A_ if you wish, and some people do, but the old-school
form is the one most widely recognized.

A load in an electrical circuit will have a specific resistance. If you know the resistance,
it is possible to calculate the current at a given voltage. Once the current
is known, you can calculate the power((("power", "calculating"))) using the relationship given in
<<sec-power_def>>:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{P = E I}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math2.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{ P = E I }$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

Ohm's law and the power equation are linear relationships, but in real applications,
there are things like the power source current limit, load power handling capacity,
and other factors to take into account that might limit the range of linearity. How a
power source will behave when it reaches its current limit depends on the type of
the source. In many cases, it will simply not generate any higher voltage once the
current limit is reached. How a load will respond when its power dissipation limit
is reached or exceeded depends on the nature of the load. It might melt, burst into
flames, or simply become an open circuit and cease to pass:[<span class="keep-together">conduct.</span>]

Now, let's have some fun with the power equation and Ohm's law. We can derive a useful variant of
the power equation by simply replacing the _E_ term with _IR_, which
results in:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{P = I^2 R}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math3.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{ P = I^2 R }$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

Substituting _E/R_ for _I_ in the original equation yields another useful variation:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{P = \frac{E^2}{R}}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math4.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{ P = \frac{E^2}{ R }}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

So, if you know the resistance and the current, you don't really need to know the
voltage drop in order to calculate the dissipated power. Or if all you know is
the voltage drop and the resistance, you can still calculate the power using the
second form.

[[sec-series_resistance]]
==== Series Resistance Networks

Resistors can be arranged in series or parallel circuits((("resistance", "series resistance networks"))) to create new values and
power handling capacity. This is useful when the value needed simply isn't available,
but a lot of the wrong parts are on hand. It is also useful when a resistance needs
to be able to handle a certain amount of power, but no such part is on hand (or might
not even be readily available). ((("resistors", "in series")))A collection of resistors connected in series or
parallel, or both, is commonly referred to as((("resistance networks"))) a _resistance network_.

When connected in series, the values of some number _n_ of resistors (where _n_ > 1) sum, as
shown in <<series_res>>.

[[series_res]]
.Resistors in series
image::images/pect_a05_mod.png["Series resistance network",align="center"]

Note that in a series network, the amount of current flowing through each resistor
is the same. You can calculate the voltage drop across each resistor, and hence the
amount of power it will dissipate, by treating the series network as a multi-tap
voltage divider, as ((("voltage dividers", "series resistance network as multi-tap voltage divider")))shown in <<series_multitap>>.

The first step is to sum the values of the resistors to get R~t~ and then use the
supply voltage (10V) to determine the total current through the network. In this
case, it works out to 0.03226A (32.26 mA):

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{I = \frac{E}{R_t}}

{I = \frac{10}{310}}

[[series_multitap]]
.Series resistance network as a multi-tap voltage divider
image::images/pect_aa06.png["Series resistance network as a multi-tap voltage divider",align="center"]

The next step is to sum the values of R2, R3, and R4, which gives 210 ohms. You can
now treat the network as a two-resistor voltage divider and use Ohm's law to find the
voltage for V~1~. This turns out to be:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{V_1 = 210 * 0.032253065 = 6.77 V}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math6.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{ V_1 = 210 &#x00D7; 0.03226 = 6.77 V }$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

Next, sum R1 and R2 to get 200 ohms, and R3 and R4 to get 110 ohms. Again apply
Ohm's law to derive V~2~:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{V_2 = 110 * 0.032253065 = 3.54 V}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math7.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{ V_2 = 110 * 0.03226 = 3.55 V }$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

Finally, just use the value of R4 to get V~3~, which gives you:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{V_3 = 100 * 0.032253065 = 3.22 V}
\end{equation}

endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math8.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{ V_3 = 100 * 0.03226 = 3.23 V }$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

Now that you have V~1~, V~2~, and V~3~ (which have been rounded appropriately), you
can work out the voltage drops((("voltage drops", "in series resistance network"))) across each resistor in the network, as shown
in <<series_vdrops>>.

As a sanity check, you can sum up the voltage drops and verify that they are equal to 10V:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]

\begin{equation}
{V_t = V_{d1} + V_{d2} + V_{d3} + V_{d4}}
\end{equation}

Finally, you can apply the voltage drops to determine what the power dissipation((("power dissipation", "calculating in series resistance network"))) will
be for each resistor, as shown in <<vdrop_pwr>>. Remember that the network current is
0.03226A through each resistor, so the power is simply the voltage drop times the
network current.

|=================================================
| R  | V drop | Power (W)
| R1 | 3.23   | 0.104

The sum of the power values for <<vdrop_pwr>> is 0.322W.

The alternative approach, which is more straightforward but not as
accurate, is to use the alternate _I_^2^ form of the power equation. Since you know
that the current in a series network is the same through all of the components,
and you know the resistance values, calculating the power dissipation for each
resistor is simplicity itself. <<isq_pwr>> list the results.

[[sec-parallel_resistance]]
==== Parallel Resistance Networks

A parallel configuration reduces the total resistance of the network, as
illustrated in <<para_res>>.((("resistance", "parallel resistance networks")))

[[para_res]]
.Resistors in parallel
image::images/pect_a08_mod.png["Parallel resistance network",align="center"]

The total resistance of a parallel resistance network with more than two elements
is given by:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{R_t = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R1}+\frac{1}{R2}+...+\frac{1}{Rn}}}
\end{equation}

---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{ R_t = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R1}+\frac{1}{R2}+...+\frac{1}{Rn}} }$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

For two parallel resistors, you can use:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{R_t = \frac{R1 x R2}{R1 + R2}}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math11a.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{R_t = \frac{R1 R2}{R1 + R2}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

If _n_ resistors in parallel have the same value, the equivalent resistance is
just the value of any one of the resistors divided by the number of resistors
in parallel:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{R_t = \frac{R}{n}}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math11b.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{R_t = \frac{R}{n}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

In order for this to work, the resistive elements _must_ have the same value. If they
are different values, you'll need to use one of the other equation forms to
compute the total resistance of the parallel network.

In a parallel network, the voltage across each resistor is the same, but the
current through((("current", "in parallel resistance networks"))) each depends on the resistance of the component, and sums into
the total current for the network:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{I_t = I_1 + ... + I_n}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math12.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{ I_t = I_1 + ... + I_n }$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

<<par_res_current>> shows how each component in a parallel resistance network
can have different amounts of power dissipation. In this case, there are three
resistive loads, perhaps lights or maybe heating elements. Although the voltage
across all three is the same, the amount of current flowing through each
differs based on its resistance.

[[par_res_current]]
.Current flow in a parallel resistance network
image::images/pect_a09_mod.png["Current flow in a parallel resistance network",align="center"]

To calculate the((("power", "calculating", "in parallel resistance network"))) power, you can use the _P_ = _I_^2^_R_ form of the power equation, because
the loads are in parallel and each can be dealt with separately from the other
elements in the network. Using 10V as the supply voltage, you can determine the
current for each using Ohm's law. Once the currents are known, _P_ = _I_^2^_R_ calculates
the power dissipation for each resistor. <<isq_par_pwr>> shows the results of the math.

[[isq_par_pwr]]
.Calculation of power dissipation in a parallel network using P = I^2^R
[width="100%",cols="^1,^1,^1",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|=================================================
| Load  | Current (A) | Power (W)
| R1    | 0.1         | 1
| R2    | 0.1         | 1
| R3    | 0.5         | 5
|=================================================

The total current demand on the power source will be 0.7A, with a total power
dissipation of 7W. The _I_^2^ form of the power equation is a good choice
here, because in a parallel network, the voltage drop across each component is
the same. What varies is the amount of current flowing through each load element.

The sanity check for <<par_res_current>> is simply to compute the parallel resistance
of the network and derive the total power from that:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{R_t = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{100}+\frac{1}{100}+\frac{1}{20}}}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math12b.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{ R_t = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{100}+\frac{1}{100}+\frac{1}{20}} }$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

This gives an _R~t~_ of 14.285714286 ohms. Using _I_ = _E/R_, you find that the total current
would be 0.7A, and _P_ = _EI_ gives 7W of power. This is the same as the _I~t~_ of 0.7A
and the 7W obtained from <<isq_par_pwr>>. Note that, while this is a valid answer, it
does not tell you the power dissipation for the invidual resistors in the network,
whereas the first form does.

=== Equivalent Circuits

When dealing with complex circuits, ((("electronics", "basic electronics theory, topics in", "equivalent circuits")))((("equivalent circuits")))it is sometimes useful to represent
the circuit in a simpler form.((("circuits", "equivalent"))) These representations are referred to as _equivalent circuits_, because they are a simplified version of what might otherwise be a very complex circuit.

The simplest DC circuit consists of a power source and a load element (e.g., the
battery and light bulb from <<Chapter_1>>). The power source produces some amount
of current at a given voltage. The current flows through the load and power is
dissipated in some form, typically heat. Working with a simple circuit like this
is much easier than trying to deal with the interactions within a complex circuit.

The use of equivalent circuits allows you to focus on the key characteristics of a
circuit or system without becoming mired in the details. One way to think of an
equivalent circuit is as a _black box_ that has some particular characteristics
(voltage, current, and resistance) but whose internal details are hidden from
view, since they don't really matter from the perspective of whatever the black
box happens to be connected to in the circuit.

==== Voltage and Current Sources

In its most common form, an equivalent circuit is composed of passive, linear
elements.((("voltage", "in equivalent circuits, sources of")))((("current", "in equivalent circuits, sources of")))((("equivalent circuits", "voltage and current sources"))) In addition to the common symbols for resistors, capacitors, and
inductors, a variety of symbols are employed with equivalent circuits to
indicate voltage and current sources. You have encountered only a voltage source
so far. <<equiv_symbols>> shows a more complete set.

[[equiv_symbols]]
.Symbols used in equivalent circuit diagrams
image::images/pect_a10_mod.png[align="center"]

Note that there are two types for both voltage and current: independent and dependent.
An independent source is not affected by changes in the connected network, while a
dependent source will change according to variables in the connected network. You
might think of a dependent source as having a knob or lever that something else
can use to alter its output. It is the dependent sources that allow an equivalent
circuit to model an active circuit element like a transistor or operational
amplifier.

==== Lumped-Parameter Elements

Equivalent circuits are simplifications ((("equivalent circuits", "lumped-parameter elements")))of more complex circuits and are
composed of lumped-parameter elements, wherein something like a resistor
in an equivalent circuit might represent many resistors (and other components)
in a complex network (e.g., a Thévenin equivalent). This applies to capacitors
and inductors as well (discussed in <<sec-ac_components>>). The main point
of an equivalent circuit is to model the behavior of a more complex circuit
by retaining the essential electrical characteristics of the original circuit in a
simplified form that aids analysis.

[[sec-thevenin]]
==== Thévenin's Theorem

Thévenin's theorem states ((("equivalent circuits", "Thévenin")))((("Thévenin&#x27;s theorem")))that any linear electrical network (complex circuit)
that is composed of only voltage sources, current sources, and resistances can
be represented by an equivalent voltage source and an equivalent resistance.
When dealing with AC circuits, you can apply Thévenin's theorem to reactive
impedances at some given frequency (see <<sec-ac_components>> for more on
reactive components).

Thévenin equivalent circuits are useful for analyzing power systems with variable
loads. For example, a power source might have a complex internal circuit, but its
Thévenin equivalent will have an equivalent behavior, which is much easier to work
with. Another application involves the simplification of a set of circuits in a
larger system so that each subcircuit can be represented by its pass:[<span class="keep-together">equivalent.</span>]

<<thev_equiv1>> shows how a simple circuit with a voltage source and five resistors
can be represented by an equivalent circuit with just a single voltage source and
one resistor. From the perspective of nodes A and B, both the original and the
equivalent would appear to be identical. Deriving a Thévenin equivalent is really
nothing more than utilizing Ohm's law and the concepts of series and parallel
resistances that were covered earlier.

[[thev_equiv1]]
[role="float-top wide"]
.Thévenin equivalent circuit example
image::images/pect_aa11.png["Thévenin equivalent circuit example with single V source",align="center"]

When you are converting a circuit to its Thévenin equivalent, the first step is to deal with
the voltage and current sources. Under normal conditions, a source will have some
amount of internal resistance, usually rather low. You can elect to ignore this and
treat the voltage and current sources as ideal sources. An ideal voltage source is
replaced with a short circuit, and an ideal current source is replaced with an open
circuit.

In order to define the equivalent circuit, you will need the equivalent voltage and
resistance. For this example, let's pick some arbitrary values:

++++
  <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="simplelist">
    <li>R1 = 100 ohms</li>
    <li>R2 = 100 ohms</li>
    <li>R3 = 200 ohms</li>
    <li>R4 = 100 ohms</li>
    <li>R5 = 200 ohms</li>
  </ul>
++++

The first step is to determine the value of the parallel network composed
of R3, R4, and R5:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{R_p = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R3} + \frac{1}{R4} + \frac{1}{R5}}}
\end{equation}
++++
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{R_p = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{200} + \frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{200}}}
\end{equation}
++++
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{R_p = 50}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]

---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{R_p = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R3} + \frac{1}{R4} + \frac{1}{R5}}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{R_p = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{200} + \frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{200}}}$

["latex","images/apxA-math13c.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{R_p = 50}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

The Thévenin-equivalent voltage (V~th~) is the voltage at the output terminals
A and B of the equivalent circuit. In this case, I've elected to treat the circuit
as a voltage divider. This arrangement is shown in step 2 of <<thev_equiv1>>.
R2 is ignored on purpose. Since this is an open circuit calculation, there is
no current flow through R2, and hence no voltage drop.

Now you can determine the open circuit voltage at point C (V~th~) in the circuit:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{V_{th} = V \frac{R_p}{R_p + R1}}
\end{equation}
++++
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{V_{th} = V \frac{50}{50 + 100}}
\end{equation}
++++
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{V_{th} = 3.33 V}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]

\Large $\displaystyle{V_{th} = V \frac{R_p}{R_p + R1}}$

["latex","images/apxA-math14c.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{V_{th} = 3.33 V}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

The Thévenin-equivalent resistance is the resistance measured across points A
and B of the circuit. To calculate the equivalent resistance, replace independent
voltage sources with short circuits, and independent current sources with open
circuits. This is shown in step 3 of <<thev_equiv1>>, where the sole voltage source
has been replaced with a short circuit. This is equivalent to R1 and R~p~ in parallel,
and R2 is now included in the calculation:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{R_{th} = R2 + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_p} + \frac{1}{R1}}}
\end{equation}
++++
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{R_{th} = 100 + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{50} + \frac{1}{100}}}
\end{equation}
++++
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{R_{th} = 133}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]

---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{R_{th} = R2 + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_p} + \frac{1}{R1}}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{R_{th} = 100 + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{50} + \frac{1}{100}}}$

["latex","images/apxA-math15d.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{R_{th} = 133}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

The result of our effort is shown in step 4 of <<thev_equiv1>>, and <<thev_final>>
shows the final result.

Thévenin equivalent circuits are not perfect representations, and they have some
limitations. The first involves linearity. Many circuits are linear only over a
specific range, so the Thévenin equivalent is valid only within that range.
Secondly, a Thévenin equivalent might not accurately model the power dissipation
of the actual complex circuit. Still, even with these caveats, Thévenin's theorem
is a handy tool to help you understand complex electrical circuits.

==== Equivalent Circuit Applications

Equivalent circuits are useful for more than just((("equivalent circuits", "applications"))) passive components. The
linear behavior of active components such as transistors and op amps can
be modeled with equivalent circuits and dependent sources. For example,
<<equiv_example>> shows a simple model of an ideal op amp.((("op amps", "equivalent circuit model for")))

In <<equiv_example>>, the idealized behavior is represented by the voltage
output as a function of the voltage drop across the input resistance times
the gain (G) of the device.

[[equiv_example]]
.An equivalent circuit example for an ideal op amp
image::images/pect_aa13.png[align="center"]

In this form, this op amp equivalent can be dropped into an
equivalent circuit model and treated like a resistor and a dependent voltage
source. A simplified model like this is useful for a rough first-order
analysis, and the level of detail can be increased as necessary to account
for elements in the circuit such as a feedback path. <<sec-op_amps>> covers op amps.

Equivalent circuits simplify the analysis of the voltage and current
characteristics of a circuit. This, in turn, allows you to make better
decisions regarding circuit power handling, battery current capacity,
and voltage requirements.

There are other circuit analysis techniques in addition to Thévenin equivalent circuits,
such as Kirchkoff's circuit laws and Norton's Theorem.((("Kirchkoff&#x27;s circuit laws"))) Since the objective of
this section is just to provide a high-level look at equivalent circuits, they aren't
covered here. If you are inclined to learn more about equivalent circuits and circuit
modeling, the texts listed in <<Appendix_D>> describe these techniques in
detail.((("circuit simulation software"))) Circuit simulation software such as PSpice (for Windows) also employs
these techniques, and using a simulator is a lot less tedious than working out
the equations by hand. Oregano and gpsim are examples of free analog circuit simulation software for Linux.

[[sec-AC_concepts]]
=== AC Concepts

Alternating current (AC), as the name implies, is a type of current flow that changes
direction periodically.((("electronics", "basic electonics theory, topics in", "AC (alternating current)", id="ix_electronicsAC")))((("AC (alternating current)", id="ix_ACconcepts", range="startofrange"))) This is what makes it useful for power transmission, audio
signals, and radio, but it also makes it more complicated. Whereas DC has only
voltage as its primary characteristic, AC also has frequency, measured in hertz (Hz)
or cycles per second, and phase, measured in degrees. In a sinusoidal waveform, such as
the one shown in <<AC_voltage>>, a cycle is a complete waveform of 0 to 360 degrees,
start to finish. AC also has a root mean square (RMS) value used to calculate power.

In most cases, the term _AC_ refers to a sinusoidal waveform, as found with
the mains current in many countries and shown in <<AC_voltage>>. Although you might
think of something like the output of a signal generator producing a sine wave at,
say, 1,000 Hz, as AC, that is more often referred to as a _signal_. The term _AC_ is
typically reserved for discussing power circuits, not signals, although
they are the same thing and the fundamental concepts of AC circuits apply to both.

[[AC_voltage]]
.AC voltage over time, a sine wave
image::images/pect_aa14.png["AC voltage over time",align="center"]

The terminology associated with AC flow can sometimes be confusing
and is dependent to a large extent on the context of usage. For example, when
talking about the power wiring in a house, you would expect to hear _AC_,
_AC voltage_, or _AC current_. These terms typically refer to the electrical
power type in general, the voltage in the circuit, and the current flowing in
the circuit, respectively. However, when referring to AC used to carry
information (as is typically found in audio, radio, and instrumentation
circuits), the common term is _AC signal_ or just _signal_.

Alternating current has several unique primary features. As shown in <<AC_voltage>>,
AC varies with time in a repeating cyclic fashion, the rate of which is its frequency.
Frequency is the measure of the number of times the signal effectively changes
direction in 1 second of time. Each time the voltage drops to zero, it is said to
have reached a _zero-crossing point_.

Secondly, AC has both positive (high) and negative (low) peaks, but an RMS
value is used for calculating power dissipation. Thirdly, AC has the characteristic of
phase, measured in units of degrees from 0 to 360. Finally, with AC, the voltage and
current can have different phases, which means that a peak in the voltage does not
have to coincide with a peak in the current. This might seem counterintuitive at
first, but it's a result of the reactance of a capacitor or inductor, which is covered
in <<sec-ac_components>>.

==== Waveforms

AC signals can occur with any one of((("AC (alternating current)", "waveforms"))) a number of different types of waveforms, but
the sine wave is the prototypical AC waveform.((("sine waves"))) A sine wave is _pure_: that is, it comprises just one frequency. Other waveforms can be decomposed into a series
of sine waves at various frequencies by means of Fourier analysis techniques (which
we will not delve into here), but a pure sine wave cannot be decomposed any further.
<<sine_wave_detail>> shows a generic sine wave.

==== Other Waveforms

Other periodic waveforms commonly encountered include square, triangle, pulse,
and ramp, shown in <<waveforms>>.

[[waveforms]]
.Common types of electrical waveforms
image::images/pect_a16_mod.png[align="center",width="400"]

Square and pulse waveforms appear mainly in digital logic circuits, because they
easily represent the 1s and 0s of binary logic. The other waveform types appear
in different contexts, such as power control circuits, timing circuits, music
synthesis devices, and motion-control applications.

One of the most common, and most useful, of the nonsinusoidal waveforms is the
_square wave_ and((("square waves")))((("pulse"))) its close relative the _pulse_. Although a square wave is usually
drawn with a shape that implies instantaneous on and off times, in reality, square
waves will include things like noninstantaneous rise and fall times, overshoot,
and ringing, as shown in <<square_wave>>.

[[square_wave]]
.Ideal versus real (typical) square wave
image::images/pect_a17_mod.png[align="center",width="400"]

The overshoot and ringing occur because of the various inductance and capacitance
effects in a circuit. Because even a wire has intrinsic inductance (as discussed in
<<sec-imp_and_react>>), sending a pulse or square wave over more than a few feet of unshielded
wire will result in a degraded signal at the receiving end.

When dealing with pulses and square waves, you'll often hear references to the duty cycle of the
waveform. In fact, a square wave is actually a special case of a pulse with a 50% duty
cycle. That is to say, it is _on_ for one-half of a cycle and _off_ for the other
half. <<pulses>> shows some pulses at various duty cycles.

[[ac_freq_volt]]
==== AC Frequency, Voltage, and Power

Every AC waveform has a frequency.((("frequency", "AC waveforms")))((("AC (alternating current)", "frequency, voltage, and power"))) The inverse of a signal’s frequency (_f_) is its
period (_t_), which is the time interval between each repetition of the waveform:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{f = \frac{1}{t}}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]

["latex","images/apxA-math32b.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{t = \frac{1}{f}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

This relationship applies to all periodic events, be it waveforms or the number of
times a temperature sensor is queried in a given time interval. For example, if a
video camera generates frames at a rate of 30 ms (milliseconds) per frame, it
is operating at a frequency of 33.33 Hz. The time period of a 60 Hz signal is about
16.67 ms. A signal with a frequency of 10 KHz (10 kilohertz, or 10,000 Hz) has a time
period of 100 μs (microseconds, sometimes written as u instead of μ).

Another essential characteristic is _amplitude_.((("amplitude"))) There are three primary ways to
describe the amplitude of an AC signal: peak amplitude, peak-to-peak amplitude, and
RMS amplitude. Take a look at <<sine_wave_detail>> again and notice that the peak
value (the A term in the sine wave equations) refers to the maximum value on either
side of the zero line. When we talk about the peak-to-peak value (often written as
V~pp~), we are referring to the range between the positive peak and negative peak.

Lastly, root mean square (RMS) amplitude((("root mean square (RMS)"))) is used to compute power (measured
in watts, as with DC circuits) in an AC circuit. RMS is also known as the _quadratic mean_.((("quadratic mean"))) For a sine wave V~rms~ = .707 * V~peak~, and for other waveforms, it will be a
different value. You can think of RMS as an average of the V~peak~, and that is how
it is used when computing power using:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{P = \frac{{V_{rms}}^2}{R}}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math33.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{P = \frac{{V_{rms}}^2}{R}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

and, conversely:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{P = {I_{rms}}^2 R}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math34.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{P = {I_{rms}}^2 R}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

Now, here’s something to consider: the AC power in your house is probably rated at
something like 120V AC (volts AC), and in some parts of the world, it might be higher.
That is its RMS value. The V~peak~ value is around 165 volts, and the V~pp~ is about
330 volts. The V~pp~ value isn’t really something to get excited about, but it might
be useful to know that the actual V~peak~ is 165 volts when you are selecting components for
use with an AC power circuit. Just remember that the RMS value is used primarily to
compute power.

==== AC Phase

The last primary characteristic to consider is _phase_, as((("AC (alternating current)", "phase")))((("phase (AC)"))) shown in <<sine_wave_detail>>.
If you consider how AC is generated electro-mechanically, you can see that the phase
angle corresponds to the rotation angle in an AC generator (also called a _dynamo_ or
_alternator_). The primary phenomena behind an AC generator, electromagnetism, is
covered in <<inductors>>. The main focus here is phase. <<ac_generator>> shows a simplified diagram of a
single-phase generator.

[[ac_generator]]
.Simplified AC generator
image::images/pect_aa19.png[width="400",align="center"]

The output from the rotating coil between the magnets (the rotor) flows through a pair
of slip rings. This allows for continuous contact with the rotor coil. As the rotor
turns, the windings in the rotor intersect the magnetic field. This in turn causes
current to flow. The direction of the motion of the windings relative to the magnetic
field determines which direction the current will flow.

As the rotor in the generator turns, the output will vary at the same rate, with the
result being a sine wave. The voltage of the output is a function of the angle of the
rotor as it moves through the magnetic field produced by the stator assembly (and the
number of windings in the rotor coil). <<phase_rotation>> shows the phase angle
relationship graphically. Note that the permanent magnets in this illustration (which
are part of the stator and don't move) are shown only once. The rotor is tagged with
a black box on one end to help keep track of it during rotation.

[[phase_rotation]]
.Phase angle and AC generator rotation
image::images/pect_aa20.png[width="400",align="center"]

Figures pass:[<a href="ac_generator">A-19</a>] and pass:[<a href="phase_rotation">A-20</a>] describe a single-phase situation. In
industrial and commercial AC power systems, it is common to find three phases (or
in some cases six or even nine), because polyphase AC circuits tend be more
efficient for power transmission and polyphase motors do not require the external
starting circuit that a single-phase motor needs to produce a starting torque.

Phase plays a big role in AC circuits. An interesting thing to note about AC signals
is that, when they are combined, the peaks and valleys of the waveforms add or subtract,
resulting in a new waveform that is the algebraic sum of the originals. If two AC
signals of exactly the same frequency but also exactly 180 degrees out of phase with
respect to each other are combined, the sum is zero: they cancel out. You can hear
the effect of _out-of-phase signals_ when((("out-of-phase signals"))) a pair of stereo speakers is miswired. If one
is phase-reversed with respect to the other, the pass:[<span class="keep-together">identical</span>] frequencies cancel, leaving
only the differences. The result is often a thin, weak sound, or if the vocals are equally
distributed on both the left and right channels, but the instruments are not, the
vocalist might seem to fade into the background or vanish completely. This, by the way,
is the basic principle behind noise-cancellation headphones.

In electronics, most of the AC will be of the single-phase type, and the main concerns
in terms of phase involve phase lead or lag, phase shift, and phase angle detection.
Although we have been talking about voltage phase up to this point, it is important
to note that both the voltage and the current have phase, and they don't have to be
coincident in time. In other words, some circuits can induce an angular difference
between the voltage phase and the current phase.((("electronics", "basic electonics theory, topics in", "ix_electronicsAC", startref ="ix_electronicsAC")))((("AC (alternating current)", startref ="ix_ACconcepts")))

[[sec-ac_components]]
=== Capacitance, Inductance, Reactance, and Impedance

This section deals with the passive components that are used with AC current:
capacitors and inductors. We will look briefly at reactance and impedance but
won't cover topics like phasor analysis or resonant circuits. These are very
interesting topics, to be sure, but they aren't something that I can easily wedge
into a summary like this and still do them justice. Out of necessity, this appendix
is an abbreviated overview, and the main intent is to introduce some basic concepts
and terminology. You are encouraged to seek out more detailed sources of information
if you wish to learn more about the topics presented here.

The primary focus of this section is to look at the basic behaviors of capacitors
and inductors, with a focus on understanding how they interact with changing current
flow. In a DC circuit, a capacitor will not pass current after it has accumulated a charge,
and an inductor will behave like a low-value resistor after it is energized. It is those
moments when current flow starts or stops when the behavior of these components becomes
apparent, and AC is continually changing. In an AC circuit, capacitors and inductors will
exhibit _reactance_, which((("reactance"))) is the opposition to changes in voltage or current flow. A
capacitor resists changes in voltage, while an inductor resists changes in current. This is due to how each type of component stores and releases energy. When combined
with a resistance, the result is impedance.

[[capacitors]]
==== Capacitors

In its most basic form, a capacitor((("capacitors"))) is a passive component that consists of two
parallel plates with a small gap between them, as shown in <<basic_cap>>. The
primary operating principle of a capacitor is the storage and release of electric
charge. A capacitor does not permit DC to pass, but it does have the effect of
allowing AC to pass.

[[basic_cap]]
.A basic air-gap capacitor
image::images/pect_aa21.png[align="center",width="300"]

As discussed in <<Chapter_8>>, most capacitors use a dialectic material (an
insulator that can be polarized by an electrical charge) rather than an air gap.
This allows the capacitor to be physically compact, and the characteristics of
the dielectric can be tailored for pass:[<span class="keep-together">specific</span>] requirements. Air can also act as a
dialectric, but it can't be tailored for a specific application.

The fundamental unit of capacitance ((("capacitance", "measurement of")))is the farad, abbreviated as F.((("farad (F)"))) One farad of
capacitance produces a potential difference of 1 volt when charged by 1
coulomb. ((("coulomb")))As defined in <<sec-current_def>>, a coulomb is equal to the amount of
charge, in the form of 6.2415093 &#x00D7; 10^18^ electrons, produced by a current of
1 ampere flowing for 1 second.

In reality, the farad is an impractically large unit of capacitance, so it is
typically specified in smaller units using the prefixes shown in <<cap_prefixes>>.

[[cap_prefixes]]
.Standard value prefixes used with capacitance
[width="100%",cols="<1,<1,<1,<3",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|==================================================================
|Prefix | Symbol | Multiplier | Equivalent
|milli  | m      | 1 &#x00D7; 10^–3^  | 1 mF or 1,000 μF
|micro  | μ      | 1 &#x00D7; 10^–6^  | 1 μF or 1,000 nF or 1,000,000 pF
|nano   | n      | 1 &#x00D7; 10^–9^  | 1 nF or 1,000 pF
|pico   | p      | 1 &#x00D7; 10^–12^ | 1 pF
|==================================================================

Although the farad is not a practical unit of capacitance for most applications,
special types of capacitors are available with values measured in farads. These are
often used as short-duration batteries for memory retention power.

When a voltage is applied to a capacitor, one of the plates will become charged
in one polarity, while the other plate will take on the opposite polarity, as
illustrated in <<cap_charge_discharge>>. This is due to the electrostatic
repulsion of like-charge particles (mentioned in <<Chapter_1>>), with the net
result being that a capacitor will accumulate charges of opposite polarity on
each of the plates. Note that <<cap_charge_discharge>> shows conventional current
flow, not electron current flow.

[[cap_charge_discharge]]
.Charge/discharge of a capacitor with DC
image::images/pect_a22_mod.png[align="center"]

When switch S1 in <<cap_charge_discharge>> is closed and S2 is open, charge will
accumulate on the plates of the capacitor. The rate at which the charge
accumulates is a function of both the capacitance of C and the value of R1
(discussed in <<sec_rc_circuits>>). When switch S1 is opened and S2 is
closed, the capacitor will discharge the energy it accumulated through resistor
R2. The discharge rate is a function of the values of R2 and C.

Another point to take away here is that when charging, a capacitor will appear
as an instantaneous short circuit to the power source. This is why resistors
and large-value capacitors almost always appear together in power-supply filter
circuits. It is generally not a good idea to connect a large capacitor directly
to a power source, because even though the short-circuit condition is present
for only a short period of time, it can lead to failure somewhere else in the circuit.
For low-value capacitors, this effect is still present, but its impact on other
surrounding components is negligible.

In an AC circuit, the capacitor will appear to pass the AC current as it charges
and discharges with each cycle.((("capacitors", "in AC circuits", "charge and discharge"))) This is shown in <<cap_ac_circuit>>, where there
is an AC source, a resistor, and a capacitor. Note that this is a greatly simplified
representation of what really happens.

[[cap_ac_circuit]]
.Charge/discharge of a capacitor with AC
image::images/pect_a23_mod.png[align="center"]

The ability of a capacitor to pass AC across what is effectively an open circuit
prompted the 19th-century physicist James Clerk Maxwell to devise the notion of an
electric displacement field. Not only did this help Maxwell visualize what was going
on, but it led to the derivation of the electromagnetic wave equation that united
electricity, magnetism, and optics.

Although calculations for electronics are done as if the components involved are
ideal in their behavior, the reality is that there are no ideal components. The
equivalent circuit for a typical capacitor, shown in <<cap_equiv>>, illustrates this.

[[cap_equiv]]
.Equivalent circuit for a typical capacitor
image::images/pect_aa24.png[align="center"]

While the resistive aspects of a capacitor cannot be completely eliminated, they
can be reduced. For the most part, however, the value of R~Series~
tends to be very low, while the value of R~Leakage~ tends to be very high, so they
can be safely ignored in most cases.

In addition to capacitive value and tolerance, capacitors are rated by working
voltage, and exceeding the working voltage can result in the catastrophic failure
of the part. In other words, it might explode. This becomes an important
consideration when you are working with series and parallel networks of capacitors, as
discussed in <<sec-series_parallel_caps>>. Also, some capacitors are _polarized_, meaning
that they have definite positive and negative connections. Electrolytic types are
usually polarized, whereas ceramic types are usually nonpolarized. Incorrectly
connecting a polarized capacitor will almost certainly damage it, sometimes
causing a failure similar to an over-voltage condition.

In general, ceramic capacitors have working voltages into the hundreds of volts,
whereas common electrolytic types range from around 10 to 100 volts. As a rule of thumb, the
lower the value of the capacitor, the higher its working voltage can be.

[[sec-series_parallel_caps]]
===== Series and Parallel Capacitors

Just as with resistors, capacitors ((("capacitors", "series and parallel")))can be combined in series and parallel, although
the math involved is a little different. <<cap_series>> shows capacitors
connected in series.

[[cap_series]]
.Capacitors connected in series
image::images/pect_aa25.png[align="center"]

When capacitors are connected in a series network, the total capacitance will be less than the
lowest value component in the network (recall that for resistors the values are
summed). ((("capacitance", "for capacitors in series network")))The effect is equivalent to reducing the size of the plates of the
capacitors in the network, thereby reducing the overall capacitance. This is
given by:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{C_t = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{C1}+\frac{1}{C2}+...+\frac{1}{Cn}}}

\Large $\displaystyle{ C_t = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{C1}+\frac{1}{C2}+...+\frac{1}{Cn}} }$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

Capacitors in parallel, as shown in <<cap_parallel>>, will have a total value
equal to the sum of the individual components in the network. This is equivalent
to increasing the overall plate area and((("capacitance", "for capacitors in a parallel network"))) thereby increasing the capacitance.

Notice that capacitors in series divide, whereas resistors sum. By the same token,
capacitors in parallel sum, but resistors divide.

[[sec-cap_coupling]]
===== Capacitive Coupling

To DC, a capacitor is an open circuit, but((("capacitors", "capacitative coupling"))) it allows AC to pass due to the fact
that the AC signal will alternately charge and discharge the plates of the capacitor.
<<cap_ac_circuit>> illustrates this when a capacitor is connected to an AC source.
<<cap_blocking>> expands on that concept with a more complete circuit.

[[cap_blocking]]
.DC blocking behavior of a capacitor
image::images/pect_aa27.png[align="center"]

There are a couple of interesting things to notice in <<cap_blocking>>, where we
have both an AC voltage source and a DC voltage source (a battery, for instance).
The first is that AC and DC can exist simultaneously on the same wire (this is
actually quite common in electronic circuits). Secondly, the AC signal will _ride_
on top of the DC voltage, with the zero-crossing level of the AC signal at the
maximum DC level. This is often referred as a _DC offset_ or a _DC bias_, depending
on the context.

Now notice in <<cap_blocking>> that you can measure the composite AC-DC signal
across R1, but the capacitor C will block the DC and allow only the AC to pass, so
taking a pass:[<span class="keep-together">measurement</span>] across R2 shows only the AC signal. We’ve neglected to consider
the interaction between the resistors and the capacitor, which will affect how the
circuit will respond at different frequencies. The next sections
on RC circuits and reactance will cover these points.

Also note that when a DC offset or bias is present, the AC waveform no longer has true
zero-crossing points when the phase is 0, 180, or 360 (0 again) degrees. In order to
sense and utilize the zero-crossing points, the DC offset must be removed. A DC offset
can also cause problems with bipolar circuits that are designed to _swing_ between
the V+ and V– supplies, such as op amps or audio amplifiers. In fact, a DC offset at
the input of a direct-coupled audio amplifier can result in speakers with burned-out
voice coils. Most speaker voice coils are not designed for continuous operation, but
the coils will be continuously energized by the offset voltage. This, in turn, will
cause the coils to overheat and eventually self-destruct.

For this reason, capacitive coupling is common in audio circuits, because the whole point
of an audio circuit is to amplify, filter, or otherwise modify an AC signal (i.e., the
audio). To deal with unwanted DC offset, capacitors are used at the inputs and between
the processing or amplification stages to block unwanted DC and pass only the audio AC
signal. The same technique is applied whenever a DC component in an input or output
might cause a circuit to saturate, become unstable, or introduce distortion in the output.

===== Capacitive Phase Shift

When current flows into a capacitor, it takes some amount of time for the voltage to((("capacitors", "capacitative phase shift")))
change. How long it will take depends on the value of the capacitor. It's akin to filling
a tub with sand. The sand might be coming in at a fixed rate, but the tub will not fill
instantly. At some point, the tub will be full of sand and the filling can stop. Assuming
that the sand is supplied at the same fixed rate, a larger tub will take longer to fill.
For any given amount of available current, a small-value capacitor will reach its maximum
charge (i.e., it will be full) sooner than a capacitor with a large plate area. In both
cases, when the charge is equal to the maximum supply potential, the current flow stops.

The main point here is that the current has to flow first, and the charge then catches
up to it. The result is that the current leads the voltage, as shown in <<cap_phase_shift>>.
Notice the 90-degree difference in the phases; this will come up again later in the
discussion of reactance and impedance.

[[cap_phase_shift]]
.Capacitive phase shift: current leads voltage
image::images/pect_a28_mod.png[width="400",align="center"]

Conversely, when the AC voltage starts to head back to zero, the current again starts to
flow, only now in the opposite direction. The current again leads the voltage and
reaches its maximum negative value 90 degrees ahead of the voltage.

[[sec_rc_circuits]]
===== RC Circuits

As you've already seen, when current is applied to a capacitor, it will initially appear((("RC (resistor-capacitor) circuits")))((("capacitors", "RC circuits")))
as a short, and current will continue to flow until the capacitor is charged. Placing a
resistor in series with the capacitor, as shown in <<rc_circuit>>, limits the amount of
current that can flow into it and consequently increases the time required to charge
the capacitor.

[[rc_circuit]]
.Simple RC circuit
image::images/pect_aa29.png[align="center"]

When the switch in <<rc_circuit>> is closed, the capacitor will begin to charge. The
amount of available current is limited by the resistor, R, so it will take longer for the
capacitor to reach V~max~ than if R were not present, as shown in <<rc_charging>>. The
current starts at the maximum possible level (I~max~) available through the resistor.

[[rc_charging]]
.R-C charge time
image::images/pect_aa30.png[align="center"]

The period between the start of current flow and when the charge is close to 100% is divided into
five intervals. The first interval, 1T, is at about 63.2% of the maximum charge on the capacitor.
Each increase of 63.2% relative to the previous interval is defined by:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]

["latex","images/apxA-math36b.png",align="left"]
.RC time constant
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{T = R C}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

_R_ is in ohms, and _C_ is in farads. This is called the _RC time constant_. _T_ is also known as
_tau_ and is expressed in units of seconds. It is derived from the mathematical constant
_e_, and some more math that defines the voltage to charge the capacitor versus time,
as discussed regarding the universal timing equation in <<sec-rc_apps>>. _I_~max~ is
determined by the value of _R_ and is the current into the capacitor when it initially
appears as a short circuit. As the capacitor charges, the current will decrease until it
reaches a value close to zero.

After each time interval, the capacitor will have charged another 63.2% from the previous
tau value, as shown in <<rc_charging2>>. In other words, with a supply of 1V, the capacitor
will have 0.632V after 1 tau, 0.865V after 2 tau, and so on until at the fifth tau it is
at 99.3% capacity with .993V.

[[rc_charging2]]
.RC tau time constant capacitor charging
[width="100%",cols="^1,^1",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|============================================
|Tau | Charge %
|1   | 63.2
|2   | 86.5
|3   | 95.0
|4   | 98.2
|5   | 99.3
|============================================

Looking again at <<rc_charging2>>, you can see that the first tau point is achieved fairly
rapidly, but after that, the charge gain for each successive tau interval slows down,
because it's an exponential function. At 2 tau (2RC), the capacitor will have gained only
an additional 23.3%, and between 2 tau and 3 tau, it will have gained only 8.5%.

Note that the 1T, 2T, etc., notation does not imply one second, two seconds, and so on.
It is simply the point at which a 63.2% relative increase in charge occurs. The value
of tau itself is time in seconds, and it can be pass:[<span class="keep-together">anything.</span>]

[[sec-rc_apps]]
===== RC Applications

The RC time constant is one of the most widely used concepts in electronics. For example,
an RC circuit ((("capacitors", "RC circuits", "applications")))((("RC (resistor-capacitor) circuits", "applications")))can be used to delay an action. Consider <<rc_delay>>, which shows an
RC circuit providing input to a 7408 TTL logic gate.

[[rc_delay]]
.Simple RC delay circuit
image::images/pect_aa31.png[align="center"]

The 1K resistor keeps one input of the gate pulled up, which prevents any false triggers
from stray gate voltage or noise. When the switch is in the Off position, the junction
of _R_ and _C_ is pulled to ground. When it is in the Start position, _C_ can begin to charge
through _R_. Since this is connected to a 7408 TTL gate, the key here is to determine the
values for _R_ and _C_ such that it will reach the threshold of the gate in the desired amount
of time. Let's pick 1 second as the target time.

We know that a TTL type gate will detect a high level input at about 2V, so when the voltage
at the junction of _R_ and _C_ reaches 2V, the logic gate will detect a high input and its output
will become high. The problem here is that with 5V supply, the 2V we want is less than the
first tau of 63.2% by 1.2 volts, since 2V is actually 40% of 5V. <<rc_threshold>> shows the
situation.

[[rc_threshold]]
.RC time delay tau charge rate
image::images/pect_aa32.png[align="center"]

We'll use the universal time constant equation, which allows us to determine the voltage
across _C_ at some point in time relative to a particular value for tau. Looking at
<<rc_threshold>>, you can see that what we want is close to being half of 1 tau, so we'll
pick tau of 2 seconds as our starting point, which should put the threshold level near
the 1 second mark.

For the voltage across _C_ at some time _T_, we can use a new equation, the universal time
constant formula, which looks like this:

[[utc_eq]]
ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{V_c = (V_s - V_i) (1 - \frac{1}{e^\frac{t}{\tau}})}

---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{V_c = (V_s - V_i) (1 - \frac{1}{e^\frac{t}{\tau}})}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

This equation describes the charging of a capacitor through a resistor at some specific
point in time as an exponential function. Remember that RC simply determines the time
between tau intervals, so to get the voltage at the in-between points, we need to compute
the voltage along the charge curve at a particular point in time.

_V~c~_ is the voltage across _C_; _V~s~_ is the final voltage minus the starting voltage, _V~i~_.
In this case, it will be (5 – 0), or just the supply voltage of 5V. The time _t_ is 1 second,
and the value of _e_, Euler's constant, is approximately 2.7182818. The value of tau, as
stated earlier, is 2. To determine the value of _V~c~_ after 1 second, plug in the values
and turn the crank:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{Vc = 5(1 - \frac{1}{e^\frac{1}{2}})}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math36d.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{Vc = 5(1 - \frac{1}{e^\frac{1}{2}})}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

This returns 1.967V for _V~c~_ after 1 second, which is probably close enough, given that
common components have between 5 and 20% tolerance ratings. In reality, if the circuit needs
a more precise time, it should probably be using a 555 timer IC (covered in <<Chapter_9>>)
or a digital timer of some sort.

We have our tau of 2, so let's pick an _R_ and see what kind of _C_ we would need. Do this
by solving the RC time constant equation for _C_, using 200 k for _R_:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{C = \frac{2}{200,000}}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math36e.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{C = \frac{2}{200000}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

This gives a value for _C_ of 0.00001 farads, which is 10 μF. This would be an
electrolytic component of some type. With an _R_ of 200 k, you can expect to see a
maximum of 25 μA into _C_ with a 5V supply, and the value of _R_ is just a number
that was chosen as a starting point because I know that the larger _R_ is, the
smaller _C_ will be for a given tau. We could also have picked a value for _C_ and
then solved for _R_.

In addition to serving as a time delay, the charging time of an RC circuit can
shift the phase of an AC signal, an effect that is dependent on the impedance of
the RC circuit, which is itself a product of the resistance and capacitance
(<<sec-imp_and_react>> discusses impedance). This behavior can be used for
AC power control applications. Thyristor devices, such as silicon-controlled
rectifiers (SCRs) and TRIACs (described in <<Chapter_9>>), are designed
for use with AC power circuits. They are triggered into conduction at a particular voltage
phase angle and continue to conduct until the phase returns to zero (or very
close to it). This is how a standard household light dimmer works, as shown in <<light_dimmer>>.

[[light_dimmer]]
.AC lamp dimmer circuit
image::images/pect_a33_mod.png[align="center"]

The dimmer works by enabling the TRIAC only for some portion of the AC waveform at
a particular phase angle. The DIAC device acts as a trigger for the TRIAC, and it
is controlled by the RC time constant of R1, R2, and C1, which form a phase delay
network. By varying R2, the 1T point is shifted and the TRIAC is triggered at the
phase angle corresponding to the delay. The TRIAC will remain in the _on_ (conductive)
state until the waveform returns to zero. The net result is that the circuit is
selecting some portion of the AC phase at which the TRIAC becomes active.
<<dimmer_action>> shows how this works.

When the phase delay is long, the voltage across C1 takes longer to reach the trigger
level of the DIAC, less of the AC waveform is passed by the TRIAC, and the lamp will
be dim. As the value of R2 is decreased, the phase delay is reduced, C1 will reach
the trigger level more quickly in the cycle, and the TRIAC will start to conduct sooner
so that more of the AC waveform is passed on to the load.

[[inductors]]
==== Inductors

When current flows in a conductor,((("inductors", id="ix_inductors",
 range="startofrange"))) it induces a magnetic field around the conductor;
and when a conductor moves through a magnetic field, a current is induced in the conductor.
The interaction between electric current and magnetism has been observed in one form or
another for over 400 years, but it wasn't formally spelled out until James Clerk Maxwell,
building on the work of Michael Faraday and others, described the relationship between
electric charge, magnetic poles, electric current, and magnetic fields in his _Treatise on
Electricity and Magnetism_ in 1873.

[[dimmer_action]]
.AC lamp dimmer phase-angle variation
image::images/pect_a34_mod.png[align="center"]

In its simplest form, an inductor is just a conductor, like a section of wire. As current
flows through the wire, a magnetic field will form around it, as shown in <<em_field>>.
The strength of the field is related to the amount of the current flowing through the
conductor. If the wire is formed into a coil, as shown in <<em_field>>, the intensity
of the magnetic field is increased proportionally to the number of turns in the coil.

[[em_field]]
.Electromagnetic fields around conductors
image::images/pect_a35_mod.png[width="500",align="center"]

Strictly speaking, an electromagnet, like the huge things used to pick up and move scrap
metal in a scrapyard, is not an inductor. Once the current starts to flow, the magnetic field
forms and will remain constant until the current flow ceases.

Inductance is the result of a changing magnetic field. During the times when the current
is starting or stopping, an inductor is creating a changing magnetic field around itself,
and this field interacts with the wire in the inductor as it expands and shrinks.

[[inductor_effect]]
.Moving magnetic field in an inductor
image::images/pect_a36_mod.png[width="200",align="center"]

Since a magnetic field will induce current flow in a conductor as the conductor moves
through the field, the same effect holds if the magnetic field moves through the conductor.
In <<inductor_effect>>, the EM field grows in steps 1 through 3, and when the current flow
through the coil returns to zero, the steps are reversed as 3 through 1. The current induced
by the EM field will want to flow in the opposite direction as the current that is creating
the EM field. In other words, an inductor will impede a change in current flow, as discussed
in <<sec-imp_and_react>>.

Whereas a capacitor impedes (blocks) DC, an inductor impedes AC. But in a DC circuit, an
inductor reacts only when the current flow is changing from off to on, or on to off. When
the current flow in a DC circuit is steady, the inductor might present a slight resistance,
but nothing else.

The unit of measurement of inductance is the _henry_. The simplistic definition of a henry
can be stated as a rate of change of current of 1 ampere per second with a resulting
electromotive force of 1 volt. The full definition
is beyond the scope of this book, and it involves magnetic field strength and other things.
If you're curious, refer to one of the texts listed in <<Appendix_D>>. For our purpose here,
the simple definition will suffice.

Like the farad, a henry is a large unit and not practical to work with, so most of the
inductors you will encounter in electronics are rated in the millihenry (mh) range. As the
value of an inductor increases, so does its effective impedance. The value of an inductor
is a function of the number of turns of wire involved (one, in the case of a single wire),
and what type of core material is used. Air does not contribute to inductance, but an iron
core, for example, does.

===== Series and Parallel Inductors

For inductors connected in series, as ((("inductors", "series and parallel")))shown in <<series_inductors>>, the current through all
the components of the network will be the same, but the voltage drop across each inductor might
be different.

[[series_inductors]]
.Inductors in series
image::images/pect_aa37.png[width="400",align="center"]

The total equivalent inductance is simply the sum of the individual inductive values:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{L_{eq} = L1 + L2 + L3}
\end{equation}

---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{L_{eq} = L1 + L2 + L3}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

Inductors in parallel have the same voltage potential across each component, but the current,
depending on the inductance and the frequency of the signal across them, will vary. <<par_inductors>>
shows a parallel inductor network with three components.

The equivalent inductance is calculated through the equation:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{L_{eq} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{L1} + \frac{1}{L2} + \frac{1}{L3}}}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math36g.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{L_{eq} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{L1} + \frac{1}{L2} + \frac{1}{L3}}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

These simple equations work only when there is no inductive coupling between the components.

[[par_inductors]]
.Inductors in parallel
image::images/pect_aa38.png[width="400",align="center"]

===== Inductive Phase Shift

When an inductor is energized, or when it is supplied with AC, the current flow is impeded
but the voltage is not. The result is that the voltage leads the current, as shown in
<<induct_phase_shift>>.

[[induct_phase_shift]]
.Inductive phase shift: voltage leads current
image::images/pect_aa39.png[width="400",align="center"]

To help understand why this is, recall that when current flows through an inductor, a magnetic
field will be created (as shown in <<inductor_effect>>). As the magnetic field expands, it
intersects the wires in the coil of the inductor. This, in turn, creates a reverse current
flow (sometimes called _back EMF_) that will oppose the incoming current. The voltage remains
unaffected, for the most part. When the voltage reaches a steady state (which is at the minimum
or maximum extents for the waveform of an AC signal), the current flow momentarily goes
to zero and the coil's field ceases to expand (or contract), and no more reverse current flow
is generated.

In the case of AC, when the voltage begins to drop in the second half of the waveform, the
inductor again creates a reverse current flow as the magnetic field collapses and the field
intersects the wires in the inductor's coil—only now the field is moving the opposite direction.

===== Inductive Kick-Back

The same effect that causes an inductor to induce lagging((("inductors", "inductive kick-back"))) current when current starts to flow or
with an AC signal is also responsible for the sharp voltage spike that is seen when a solenoid-type inductor (i.e., a relay) is de-energized. Consider the simple circuit shown in <<ind_kickback>>.

[[ind_kickback]]
[role="float-top wide"]
.Voltage spike created when an inductor is de-energized
image::images/pect_a40_mod.png[align="center"]

The graph on the right side of <<ind_kickback>> shows what you could expect to see if you
monitored the voltage drop across the inductor with an oscilloscope. The spike that appears when
current ceases to flow in the inductor arises as the magnetic field in the inductor collapses.
This occurs very quickly, and the spike is often very large (sometimes many hundreds of volts).
As the field collapses, the effective direction of current flow will remain the same, but the
voltage across the coil will be inverted, because it is now acting as a current source. Also,
notice the the current flow in <<ind_kickback>> is shown as electron flow, not conventional
current flow.

The kick-back voltage from an inductor can create arcing across switch contacts, and it can
easily destroy solid-state devices. Since in a DC circuit the spike will always be the opposite
polarity of the voltage that energized the coil, a diode can be used to return the spike back
to the coil and harmlessly dissipate its energy, as shown in <<diode_snubber>>.

[[diode_snubber]]
.Using a diode to snub the reverse spike from an inductor
image::images/pect_a41_mod.png[width="500",align="center"]

When an active component, such as an IC or a transistor, is used to drive a relay, the kick-back
from the coil in the relay can destroy the solid-state part by suddenly presenting a voltage
that is far beyond what the device might be rated for, as shown in <<driver_spike>>.

[[driver_spike]]
.Protecting a transistor with a kick-back snubber diode
image::images/pect_a42_mod.png[width="500",align="center"]

Notice that, from the perspective of the transistor, the spike from the relay appears to be
positive. This is because, when the field pass:[<span class="keep-together">collapses,</span>] the coil becomes a momentary current source
and the current flow is the same direction as when it was energized. The end of the relay coil
connected to the transistor becomes positive, and the now negative end of the relay coil is
connected to the positive power supply. It is equivalent to inserting a battery in place of
the relay. With a diode installed across the coil of the relay, it effectively short-circuits
the reverse voltage current flow from the coil due to field collapse, thereby saving the
transistor from pass:[<span class="keep-together">destruction.</span>]

[[sec-imp_and_react]]
==== Impedance and Reactance

Capacitors resist changes in voltage, and inductors resist changes in current. In AC circuits,
this opposition is typically called _impedance_, and the reactance of the component is a
fundamental part of the impedance. This section provides a quick summary of reactance and
impedance, but working through the math in detail is beyond the scope of this book. Refer
to one of the texts on electronics in <<Appendix_D>> for the low-level details. The _ARRL Handbook_ and William Orr's _Radio Handbook_, for example, both cover these topics in some detail,
with lots of practical applications for tuned circuits and antennas.

===== Reactance

The reactance is the opposition of a ((("reactance")))circuit element to changes in voltage or current, and it
is a result of the circuit element's capacitance or inductance. So, although they are typically
classified as passive components, capacitors and inductors also fall into the category of
reactive components.

As shown earlier in the sections on capacitors and inductors, reactive components store
and release energy. Capacitors store voltage in the form of an electric field, while inductors
store current in the form of a magnetic field. Because work is required to store the energy
in the components, they appear as loads when the current is changing. In an AC circuit, the
current is constantly changing, so the load is persistent. This, in essence, is reactance.
It is similar in some respects to resistance, but it is not the same thing.

It is reactance that gives rise to impedance. In an AC circuit, reactance is frequency dependent.
Reactive components don't typically respond to DC (except for the appearance and cessation of
current flow). An inductor, for example, will appear as a simple resistance to DC. A capacitor
will appear as an open circuit. An ideal resistor, on the other hand, does not react to a change
in current flow. It just presents a resistance regardless of whether or not the current flow
is DC or AC.

The magnitude of the reactance of a capacitor is inversely proportional to frequency. In other
words, the higher the frequency, the lower the reactance of the capacitor to the AC signal. The
magnitude of the reactance of an inductor is also proportional to frequency, with the reactance
increasing as the frequency increases. It is the opposite of a capacitor. <<react_vs_freq>> shows
these relationships graphically. Note that reactance is denoted with the symbols X~L~ and X~C~
and specified in units of ohms.

[[react_vs_freq]]
.Inductive and capacitive reactance versus frequency
image::images/pect_a43_mod.png[width="500",align="center"]

These types of plots would usually employ a logarithmic scale to make them easier to comprehend,
but it's informative to see them in their raw form.

The math necessary to find the reactance of a capacitor or inductor is straightforward. For
capacitive reactance, you can do the pass:[<span class="keep-together">following:</span>]

Note that _C_ is in farads, _L_ is in henries, and both _X~C~_ and _X~L~_ are in ohms. Also recall that:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{\omega = 2 \pi f}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

===== Impedance

Impedance is the sum of resistance and reactance.((("impedance"))) Ideal capacitors and inductors have
only reactance, and they will cause a shift in the phase of the current relative to voltage.
A resistor does have an associated phase shift, because it is not a reactive pass:[<span class="keep-together">component.</span>]

In a purely reactive component, the phase shift is always 90 degrees. A capacitor causes
the current phase to lag (–90 degrees) and an inductor causes the current phase to lead
(+90 degrees). Impedance is what happens when a resistance enters the picture and modifies
the current flow, although the term _impedance_ is also used when we are discussing interaction
of capacitors and inductors with an AC signal.

As shown earlier with RC circuits, a resistance can change the rate of charge on a
capacitor and in the process alter the voltage-current phase relationship to some angle
other than 90 degrees. This is the key principle behind the TRIAC circuit
presented pass:[<span class="keep-together">earlier.</span>]

The letter _Z_ is used to denote impedance, and the relationship is given as:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{Z = R + jX}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math36k.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{Z = R + jX}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

Note that _j_ is the square root of –1, an _imaginary_ number. Conventional mathematics uses
the letter _i_; but in engineering, the letter _j_ is used to avoid confusion with _I_, the letter
used for current.

One of the main applications of the concept of impedance arises when we consider a circuit as
a whole, with all of its internal resistances and reactances. Recall that the unit of measure
for reactance is ohms and that, for a particular frequency, a capacitor or inductor will have
a specific reactance. It follows then that we could apply Thévenin's theorem to a circuit
composed of resistances and reactances, and this is indeed the case. From this we can
determine the impedance of the equivalent circuit. In the interests of keeping this
appendix short and concise, we won't work through the math, but there are excellent examples
in the text listed in <<Appendix_D>>.

[[sec-passive_filtering]]
===== Passive Filtering

A combination of resistance, capacitance,((("filters", "passive"))) and inductance can and often is used for passive
filtering. _Passive filters_, as ((("passive filters")))the name implies, have no signal amplifying elements such as
transistors or op amps. Consequently, a passive filter has no signal gain. This means that
the output level of a passive filter is always less than the input.

For low frequencies (from 0 to around 100 kHz), passive filters are generally constructed
with simple RC networks, while higher frequency filters (above 100 kHz, or RF-type signals)
are usually made from a combination of RLC components. This section looks at simple
low-pass and high-pass RC filters as a way of showing how the concepts of reactance and
impedance for RC circuits can be applied in practical ways. Although we won't get into LC
and RLC filters, the concepts for these also follow from the material already presented,
and in-depth discussions can be found in the texts listed in <<Appendix_D>>.

Recall that a capacitor will pass high frequencies but block low frequencies (including DC).
This implies that a capacitor in parallel across an AC signal will shunt high frequencies
to ground, and a capacitor in series with the signal will pass high frequencies but block
low frequencies. The inclusion of a resistor into the network allows the behavior to be
adjusted for a specific range of pass:[<span class="keep-together">frequencies.</span>]

<<low_pass>> shows a simple RC low-pass filter. In this arrangement, the capacitor, _C_, will
shunt high-frequency signals to ground, but allow low-frequency signals to pass through from
input to output.

[[low_pass]]
.Low-pass RC filter
image::images/pect_a44_mod.png[width="400", align="center"]

The cutoff frequency, _f~c~_, is defined to be the point where the output of the filter drops
by –3 dB. Decibels are commonly used with AC signals, and it is a logarithmic
scale. Decibels are used to express the ratio between two values, and in the case of
<<low_pass>>, it refers to the decrease in the output of the filter at the cut-off frequency.
The _cut-off_ pass:[<span class="keep-together"><em>frequency</em></span>] is the point where the response begins the drop towards zero, and it
is at this point where the capacitive reactance and the resistance are equal, and the
output is 70.7% of the input.

The rate at which the filter will attenuate the signal is called the _roll-off_ rate and is
expressed in dB per decade, or dB per octave. A decade is a 10-fold change in frequency, and
an octave is a 2-fold change in frequency. A passive low-pass or high-pass RC filter will
typically exhibit a 20 dB/decade roll-off.

The cut-off frequency for a low-pass filter is calculated as follows:

[[lp_cutoff]]

\begin{equation}
{f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C}}

---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

Assume you wanted to filter an input to an A/D converter (an ADC) to reject any noise that
might be present. If the signal you want to sample will always be less than 100 Hz,
you can rearrange the equation, pick a value for _R_, and solve for _C_ at 100 Hz. Let's pick
a value for _R_, say 10,000 ohms, and shuffle the preceding equation to solve for _C_:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{C = \frac{1}{2 \pi R f_c}}
\end{equation}

\Large $\displaystyle{\frac{1}{2 \pi * 10000 * 100} = 0.000000159}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

Remember that _C_ is in farads, so the capacitor needed is 0.159 μF. A 0.15 μF part
is close enough, and it is a standard value. Since there is an inverse relationship
between the value of _R_ and the value of _C_, picking pass:[<span class="keep-together">something</span>] like 10 k ohms for _R_
is a reasonable place to start.

A high-pass filter takes advantage of the reactance of a capacitor to block
signals below the cut-off frequency. <<high_pass>> shows a high-pass RC filter.
The equation for a passive high-pass filter is the same as for the low-pass filter.

[[high_pass]]
.High-pass RC filter
image::images/pect_a45_mod.png[width="400", align="center"]

Both of the filters shown here are called _single-pole filters_, meaning there is
only one network of _R_ and _C_. _Multi-pole filters_ use two of more RC filters
to increase the roll-off rate of the filter response, but at the cost of
increased signal attenuation and filter pass:[<span class="keep-together">accuracy.</span>]((("inductors", range="endofrange", startref ="ix_inductors")))

=== Solid-State Concepts

This section presents a high-level overview of solid-state devices.((("solid-state concepts", id="ix_SSC", range="startofrange"))) The brevity is
out of necessity, since there is not enough room to cover the field with any
significant level of detail. Ideally, you should be able to get a handle on the
basic concepts and have a good idea where to turn next for more pass:[<span class="keep-together">information.</span>]

As discussed in <<Chapter_1>>, copper, silver, and gold are good conductors,
and things like plastics, ceramics, and sulfur are good insulators. Semiconductor
materials such as silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), or gallium arsenide (GaAs) lie
between insulators and conductors. In terms of conductivity, we can say that
they are only partially conductive, hence the name _semiconductor_. But a semiconductor
is not a resistor, because a semiconductor will exhibit nonlinear behavior under
certain conditions, whereas a resistor will always behave in a linear fashion in
response to current.

Silicon-based semiconductor components are fabricated on thin sheets cut from a silicon crystal grown
in a special oven. Each circular sheet, called a _wafer_, can contain hundreds of
individual parts. After the parts are created on the surface of the wafer, they are
tested using automated machinery. Those parts that fail testing are tagged by
their location on the wafer and will be discarded later when a diamond saw cuts
the wafer up into individual chips. The chips are then mounted in a package of
some type: small diodes in a package with two lead, transistors in a three-terminal
package, and ICs in packages with anywhere from 8 to 144 leads or contact points,
or more.

The manufacture of semiconductors is complex and utilizes highly specialized and
expensive automated equipment. However, many millions of solid-state devices are
produced each year, and the economy of scale, coupled with high levels of automation,
allow prices to remain astonishingly low. The advances in technology have continued
unabated over the years, with each new generation of semiconductor components being
smaller, cheaper, and denser than the preceding generation. As Gordon Moore, Chairman
Emeritus of Intel, was reported to have said in 1998, "If the automobile industry
advanced as rapidly as the semiconductor industry, a Rolls-Royce would get half a
million miles per gallon, and it would be cheaper to throw it away than to park it."

==== The P-N Junction

Modern solid-state devices are based on the physics of semiconductor materials that
have been altered (or _doped_) to enhance their ability to conduct current in a
particular manner. The doping takes the form of an infusion of so-called _impurities_
(impure in the sense that they are not part of the original semiconductor). These
atoms are the donors and acceptors of electrons that allow current to flow across
the junction.

The basic arrangement of semiconductor material with different characteristics is
called a _P-N junction_, and this is the basis for the ubiquitous diode. Adding a
second junction results in a bipolar junction transistor (a BJT), and other
arrangements are used to create field-effect transistors (FETs), SCRs, TRIACs,
Zener diodes, LEDs, and integrated circuits. <<pn_junction>> shows a simplified diagram of a P-N junction. 

[[pn_junction]]
.Simplified P-N junction
image::images/pect_a46_mod.png[width="400", align="center"]

Shortly after the
junction is formed, some of the free electrons from the N side move to the P side.
At the same time, positive _holes_ (where an electron is missing) move through the
semiconductor from the P side to the N side. When no more charges can move (or
diffuse), the result is a region at the junction that is depleted of any free charge
carriers, called the depletion layer, and a charge gradient appears across the
junction.

[[diodes_and_rec_appa]]
==== Diodes and Rectifiers

The interface between P- and N-type semiconductor material moves charge more easily
in one direction than the other so that negative charges in the form of electrons
can flow easily from the N to the P side of the junction, but not in the opposite
direction. This is the basis for solid-state diodes. <<pn_diode>> shows how the
symbol for a diode correlates with the P and N semiconductor material in the
component. The semiconductor material is usually silicon crystal, but special-purpose
diodes can employ germanium or gallium arsenide.

[[pn_diode]]
.P-N junction diode
image::images/pect_aa47.png[width="400", align="center"]

Referring back to <<pn_junction>>, you can see that the N-type material has a surplus
of electrons (e–), also called _charge carriers_, while the P-type material has a surplus
of positive charge carriers called _holes_. Note that there no charge carriers in the
depletion layer.

For a simple P-N junction device, when a voltage is placed across a diode with the
opposite polarity as the inherent potential across the depletion layer, the
process of charge migration that initially occurred when the junction was formed will
begin again, and as a result, current will flow across the junction. A P-N junction in
this state is said to be _forward biased_. When an external voltage is applied to the
junction with the same polarity as the junction's potential gradient, the depletion
layer will simply continue to act as an insulator, pass:[<span class="keep-together">blocking</span>] the movement of electrons
and holes and thereby preventing current flow. This is called _reverse bias_.

The junction potential for silicon diode is approximately 0.7V. For Germanium diodes, it
is around 0.3V, and Schottky diodes are about 0.2V. In order for a diode to be forward
biased, the external voltage must exceed the junction potential. This is sometimes
referred to as the _threshold voltage_ of a diode. It conducts when the external voltage
is greater than the threshold, but it does not conduct when it is less than the threshold
level.

A common way to visualize what is going on in the P-N junction of a diode is called an
_I-V curve_, as shown in <<iv_curve>>. As you can see, the diode will not conduct until
the voltage across it reaches the junction threshold, after which it conducts in a
logarithmic pass:[<span class="keep-together">fashion.</span>]

[[iv_curve]]
.I-V curve for a common silicon diode
image::images/pect_aa48.png[width="400", align="center"]

One of the parameters used with diodes (and any solid-state part, for that matter) is
the _peak-inverse-voltage_ (PIV), which is the maximum voltage that the part can tolerate
in the reverse bias state before the P-N junction breaks down. The graph in <<iv_curve>> shows a small
amount of current flowing while the device is reverse biased. This is called the _reverse saturation current_, and it is typically very small, on the order of pass:[<span class="keep-together">microamps.</span>]

In reality, the physical structure of a diode doesn't really look like <<pn_diode>>.
Semiconductors are fabricated over a series of steps that might involve photolithography,
depositation of metals, oxidation, the introduction of doping impurities, and chemical
etching. The entire operation takes place in a so-called _clean room_, where the air has
been filtered to the point where there are almost no particles of dust or dirt that
might contaminate the semiconductor and ruin the parts during fabrication.

<<diode_fab1>> shows a more realistic view of a slice through a diode that has been
created on a layer of semiconductor using a _fused junction_ technique.
This involves placing a tiny pellet of a P-type impurity (perhaps aluminum or indium)
onto the surface of an N-type semiconductor crystal and then heating it until the
pellet melts into the semiconductor. This leaves a P-type region where the pellet was
placed, and the part of the pellet that doesn't fuse with the semiconductor becomes
the anode terminal.

[[diode_fab1]]
.Structure of a diode made using the fused junction process
image::images/pect_a49_mod.png[width="400", align="center"]

Another technique, called _planar diffusion_ or _epitaxial growth_, involves
the diffusion of a P-type region into an N-type semiconductor that sits atop a
conductive substrate material. A layer of silicon-dioxide (SiO2) is grown on top of
the semiconductor, a section is etched away to expose the P-type material, and finally,
a metallic layer is deposited into the space created in the SiO2 layer. This forms the
anode of the diode. A metallic layer on the bottom of the substrate forms the cathode
terminal of the diode. <<diode_fab2>> shows a cross-section view of a planar diffusion
diode.

[[diode_fab2]]
.Structure of a diode created using a planar diffusion process

==== Special-Purpose Diodes

In addition to small-signal diodes, other types of diodes are available for power rectification
that are capable of handling significant amounts of the current. There are also Zener,
avalanche, and Schottky types, as well as LEDs and photodiodes.

===== Zener Diode

A Zener diode is designed to operate in the reverse-bias mode without damage, at least
until its maximum current rating is exceeded. When the reverse voltage across a Zener
reaches a particular level, as determined at the time the device is fabricated, it will
conduct. The I-V curve for a Zener looks similar to that for a standard diode, except that the
Zener effect occurs at a much lower reverse voltage than the breakdown in a standard diode.
Zener diodes are available in a wide range of voltages and are used to establish reference
voltages and as signal limiters. <<zener_circuit>> shows how a 5.6V Zener diode can be used to limit
a variable voltage.

[[zener_circuit]]
.A Zener diode as a voltage limiter
image::images/pect_aa51.png[width="400", align="center"]

===== Avalanche Diode

An avalanche diode is similar to a Zener diode and, actually, the Zener and avalanche diodes
exhibit both types of behaviors. But whereas the Zener diode is designed to go into reverse
conduction at a specific voltage, the reverse voltage drop in an avalanche diode becomes
low once it begins to conduct, and the transition to reverse current flow is very fast.
This makes avalanche diodes ideal for protection circuits such as spike protection.

===== Photodiodes

A photodiode uses the energy of photons to move charge across a junction. A standard P-N
junction is photosensitive, but a PIN junction offers improved response speed. A PIN junction
comprises P- and N-type material with a thin layer of the element indium in between
(hence the I in PIN).

When a photon strikes the junction of a diode, it creates an electron-hole pair. Since the
junction has a voltage gradient, the electron is pulled into the N region and the cathode, while
the positive hole is swept into the P region toward the anode. The result is a photocurrent.

A photodiode can be designed to operate in either a photovoltaic mode or in a photoconductive
mode. In the photovoltaic mode, no bias voltage is applied to the diode, and the device will
produce a voltage when it is illuminated due to the photovoltaic effect. In fact, solar cells
are just very large photodiodes. In the photoconductive mode, the photodiode is typically reverse
biased, and impinging photons will cause a reverse current flow that is proportional to the
light level.

Photodiodes are found in a number of applications, ranging from IR remote-control receivers
to camera light-level sensors, and from streetlight darkness sensors to the detector in an
optical isolator.

===== LEDs

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are legion and can be found almost everywhere. They have largely
pushed out the older incandescent technologies for miniature lamps and have started to make
significant inroads into residential and commercial lighting applications. They are also cheap,
and bags of LEDs can be had for the equivalent of pennies per device.

Internally, an LED is a diode, and it behaves just like any other diode. The big differences can be found
in the materials used for the pass:[<span class="keep-together">semiconductor</span>] and the fact that these materials allow the LED
to produce light when current passes through it.

<<LED_innards>> shows the basics of how an LED produces light. When a bias is applied to the
LED, electrons will flow from the N side toward the P side. At the same time, positive holes
are moving from the P side toward the N side of the device. The charge carriers move into the
junction with different potentials, with the electrons being at a higher potential. When an
electron meets a hole, it essentially falls into the hole. In the process, it drops to a lower
energy state and a photon is released. In silicon or germanium diodes, the same process occurs
when there is current flow, but no light is emitted.

[[transistors_appa]]
==== Transistors

Transistors are a fundamental building block of modern electronics. When they first appeared,
they were a radical departure from the vacuum tubes (valves) they started to replace, and
they were difficult for many people to understand. But the advantages of the transistor vastly
outweighed the unconventional physics of their operation, and the vacuum tube soon started
its march into oblivion. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors are small and compact, use
very little power, and don't generate massive amounts of heat. Without the transistor, it
would not have been possible to create integrated circuits and achieve the levels of
miniaturization that are common today.

This section is just a light overview of transistors. It is intended to serve as an
introduction, not as a comprehensive tutorial. For a more detailed description of what
is going on inside a transistor, and for descriptions of other solid-state devices such
as UJTs, SCRs, and TRIACs, refer to the texts listed in <<Appendix_D>>.

===== Bipolar Junction Transistors

Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) come in two basic forms: PNP and NPN. The names arise
from how these devices are fabricated from P- and N-type semiconductors. <<pnp_xsistor>>
shows a PNP device, and <<npn_xsistor>> shows an NPN device.

[[pnp_xsistor]]
.PNP BJT transistor internal structure
image::images/pect_aa53.png[width="300", align="center"]

[[npn_xsistor]]
.NPN BJT transistor internal structure
image::images/pect_aa54.png[width="300", align="center"]

For an NPN transistor, the collector must be more positive than the emitter. The base-emitter
and base-collector junctions behave like diodes. In an NPN device, current can flow through
base-emitter junction, but the base-collector junction will be reverse biased. A PNP is simply
the opposite of an NPN.

A transistor works by modifying the current flow between the emitter and collector pass:[<span class="keep-together">terminals</span>]
by supplying a current to the base terminal. Thus, a small signal current can control a much
larger current, and the amount of change in current between the emitter and the collector
is a function of the gain (or h~fe~) of the device.

Internally, the base and emitter terminals of an NPN device behave like a diode. The amount
of current flowing through the collector, I~c~, is approximately proportional to the amount
of current flowing into the base through the base-emitter junction (I~b~):

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{I_c = I_b h_{fe}}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math36p.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{I_c = I_b h_{fe}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

where h~fe~ is the current gain, or beta, of the transistor.

Transistors are nonlinear devices, so the relationship between the input and the output
isn't a straight line. Depending on the h~fe~ and other characteristics, you might need to bias a transistor by applying a small constant DC offset to the base terminal. This
will move the input signal into the linear region of the device's response curve. Without
this bias, some part of the input signal might get cut off or distorted.

When a transistor is used as a switch, the idea is to push it into _saturation_:
that is, into a state where the current is flowing freely between the collector and the
emitter, and the voltage drop across the terminals is minimal. The trick to achieving
saturation is supplying sufficient base current (I~b~).

===== Field-Effect Transistors

A field-effect transistor (FET) differs from a BJT in that a voltage is used to control current
flow through the device instead of a current. A FET has three terminals labeled _drain_,
_source_, and _gate_. A small voltage change on the gate controls the current flow between
the drain and source terminals. As with BJT devices, FETs come in both N and P types,
and there are other variations such as MOSFETs, which as based on a metal-oxide
semiconductor (the MOS part of MOSFET). <<fet_structure>> shows a cross-section view
of the internal structure of a MOSFET device.

[[fet_structure]]
.Internal cross-section of a MOSFET
image::images/pect_a55_mod.png[width="300", align="center"]

The primary current flow through a FET is from source to drain. The amount of current
flow is determined by the voltage on the gate terminal. What is happening is that the
gate voltage modulates the ability of charge carriers (holes and electrons) to move
between the source and drain terminals. In this sense, a FET behaves much like a vacuum
tube and, in fact, there have been solid-state replacements constructed for some types
of vacuum tubes that utilize high-voltage FET devices.

FETs are also used extensively for signal and power switching. A FET that is in the
_on_ state (fully conductive) can present a very low resistance to current flow. Analog
signal multiplexer chips, such as the Analog Devices ADG506A, use CMOS devices (a type of
FET) to select input signals. Each channel has an _on_ resistance of about 280 ohms.

Other applications for power control might utilize high-power MOSFETs to control
DC power from a battery. By using a part with a low _on_ resistance, the need for a
relay can be eliminated. The IRF710 is an example of a power MOSFET in a TO-220
package. It has a maximum _on_ resistance of 3.6 ohms and is capable of dissipating
around 36W of power.((("solid state concepts", range="endofrange", startref ="ix_SSC")))

[[sec-op_amps]]
=== Operational Amplifiers

The operational amplifier (or _op amp_) is an old device.((("operational amplifiers (op amps)"))) Early versions existed as
vacuum-tube circuits developed for use in early analog computers. An op amp is a
high-gain DC-coupled differential amplifier. The op amp schematic symbol uses + and –
to denote the noninverting and inverting inputs, respectively, not the polarity
of the input voltage.

As it is a differential amplifier, the output of an op amp is an amplified version of
the difference between the inputs. In other words, if the noninverting (+) input is
higher than the inverting (–) input, then the output of the op amp will be positive.
If the inverting input is higher than the noninverting input, then the output will
be negative.

Modern op amps are often powered with a bipolar supply, typically +/–15 VDC, although
there are op amps available that will work with a single supply voltage. The use of a +/–
DC supply allows the op amp to swing its output from – to + in response to the inputs.

Texas Instruments offers a http://bit.ly/amp-handbk[downloadable version of the "Handbook of Operational Amplifier Applications"] and Analog Devices offers a http://bit.ly/op-amp-basics[free "Op Amp Basics" guide].

==== Basic Op Amp Circuits

Feedback is used to set the overall gain of the op amp circuit. Without some kind of((("operational amplifiers (op amps)", "basic circuits")))
feedback, a high-gain op amp will respond dramatically to the inputs, with the output
going full positive or full negative with just a minute amount of input difference.
For this reason, op amps are seldom used without some kind of feedback network.

Op amp circuits can be either inverting or noninverting with regard to the original
input. <<inv_op_amp>> shows a simple inverting op amp circuit (you can try it with a
741 device or something similar if you want to play with it).

[[inv_op_amp]]
.Simple inverting op amp circuit
image::images/pect_aa56.png[width="300", align="center"]

The basic principle behind the op amp circuit in <<inv_op_amp>> is straightforward: the
op amp uses its output to attempt to force the difference between the inputs to zero volts.
Since the output is coupled to the input via R2, the output voltage will appear at
the junction of R1 and R2 (called a _summing junction_) and it will be summed with the
input voltage through R1. The simple math to determine R1 and R2 looks like this:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{Gain = \frac{-R2}{R1}}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math36q.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{Gain = \frac{-R2}{R1}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

This is equivalent to:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{Gain = \frac{V_{OUT}}{V_{IN}}}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math36r.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{Gain = \frac{V_{OUT}}{V_{IN}}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

So the voltage gain of the circuit is the ratio of output to input, and it is set by
the ratio of R2 to R1. The negative sign on R2 doesn't mean negative resistance; it
simply means that this is an inverting amplifier.

If we wanted a DC amplifier with a gain of 4, perhaps to boost the signal level from
a sensor or match the output of our circuit to something else, then we would select
a value for R1 and then then solve for R2 with a gain value of 4. In <<inv_amp_4X>>
R1 has been set to 10K ohms, which means R2 will be 40K.

[[inv_amp_4X]]
.Inverting op amp circuit with a gain of 4
image::images/pect_aa57.png[width="300", align="center"]

Since the inverting input is always low (it's tied to ground), voltage at B will be
zero. If A goes positive, then the output will swing negative so that the sum of the
voltages at point A in the circuit will also be zero—hence the inversion. Another
effect of this is that point A can be considered to be a virtual ground, since the
op amp's output will always try to make it match the inverting input.

The output impedance of an op amp circuit like the ones shown here is typically a
fraction of an ohm. The input impedance of an inverting amplifier is dependent on the
value of R1. In some situations R1 might end up being small, and this can create
impedance matching and input loading problems. The non-inverting form of the op amp
circuit shown in <<noninv_op_amp>> solves this problem.

[[noninv_op_amp]]
.Simple non-inverting op amp
image::images/pect_aa58.png[width="300", align="center"]

Notice in <<noninv_op_amp>> that the inverting input is supplied by a voltage
divider comprised of R1 and R2. This adds a slight twist to the math for computing
R1 and R2:

ifndef::html[]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
{Gain = 1 + \frac{R2}{R1}}
\end{equation}
++++
endif::html[]
ifdef::html[]
["latex","images/apxA-math36r.png",align="left"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\Large $\displaystyle{Gain = 1 + \frac{R2}{R1}}$
---------------------------------------------------------------------
endif::html[]

Because op amps are DC amplifiers by design, to work with AC signals and not have to deal
with a DC bias hitching a ride on the input or output requires the use of coupling capacitors,
which were covered in <<sec-cap_coupling>>.

==== Specialized Op Amps

There are many varieties of op amps available. Some have very fast response times, and((("operational amplifiers (op amps)", "specialized")))
others are capable of handling large amounts of output current. Still others feature extremely
low noise operation or low current consumption, or have been designed to minimize the
amount of external circuitry required.

The LM386 is a good example of an op amp with a specialized output section that requires
a minimal amount of external components. It is intended primarily as an audio amplifier.
<<lm386>> shows the pin-out of the DIP package.

[[lm386]]
.The LM386 op amp IC
image::images/pect_a59_mod.png[width="300", align="center"]

The circuit shown in <<audio_amp>> can drive an 8-ohm speaker directly, and because the output
is coupled to the speaker with a capacitor, there need not be too much concern about stray DC
on the input damaging the speaker. This little circuit is handy to have around if you need to trace an audio signal through a live circuit (in this case, an input coupling capacitor
would be a necessity), check the output of a signal generator circuit, or integrate an audio
output into something that didn't originally have one. Kits are readily available for LM386
amplifier modules in the $10 (USD) range.

.Audio amplifier using an LM386

=== Noise

Noise is the bane of electronic circuits, particularly those that deal with low-level signals.
In general, noise is any unwanted spurious or periodic signal or voltage that might interfere
with the intended operation of a circuit. It might be switching spikes from a nearby relay or
power contactor, or it could be stray 60 Hz picked up from nearby appliances or power lines.
It might even be a local AM radio station or a ham-radio operator with a high-power rig. This
section describes some simple ways to deal with noise.

==== Noise Sources

Noise can arise from many sources. Low-frequency noise, in the form of spikes and stray AC, is
often the result of either power line spikes, inductive coupling, or a load switching on and
off somewhere in the circuit. It can also occur when the ground return has a slight resistance,
perhaps due to a poor connection or even corrosion. RF interference (RFI) can be a problem
with wireless data links and other types of radio frequency devices, and under certain pass:[<span class="keep-together">conditions,</span>]
a strong radio signal can be detected and reproduced by an audio amplifier. If the transmitter
is mistuned, and it's not your transmitter, there might not be much that can be done
except to complain about it. However, in many cases, the solution is as simple as making sure
that things are correctly shielded and grounded.

==== AC Line Noise

To deal with a noisy AC power line, such as the mains from a wall socket, you can use a filter, such as
the one shown in <<ac_filter>>. This is an off-the-shelf module that sells for
about $20 (USD), and most major distributors carry items like this. If you disassemble
old surplus equipment, you can often find one of these tucked away inside.

[[ac_filter]]
.AC power line filter module
image::images/pect_aa61.png[width="300", align="center"]

Some IEC-type power cord socket assemblies have a line filter built in, such as the unit
shown in <<IEC_line_filter>>. These are available for about $2 each from distributors such
as Jameco (see <<Appendix_E>>).

[[IEC_line_filter]]
.Modular IEC power cable connector with built-in line filter
image::images/pect_aa62.png[width="300", align="center"]

Both the filter module shown in <<ac_filter>> and the integrated module shown in <<IEC_line_filter>>
actually contain a surprising amount of circuitry inside. <<filter_schem>> shows what is tucked
into a typical filter module like the one shown in <<IEC_line_filter>>.

[[filter_schem]]
.AC line filter module schematic
image::images/pect_aa63.png[width="500", align="center"]

This type of filter is designed to suppress unwanted signals at 100 KHz and above without
interfering with the 60 Hz AC main. Because spikes typically have fast rise times equivalent
to a high-frequency signal, the filter will help to suppress these. The arrangement of
capacitors and inductors presents a significant insertion loss to both differential noise
and common mode noise.

Although it is possible to build a filter from some capacitors, it's generally not worth the
effort. For a few dollars, you can get something already built and tested.

==== AC Ripple

A small residual amount of AC on a DC power-supply line is referred to as _AC ripple_.((("AC ripple"))) In some
cases, it might be small enough to not cause a problem, but in other cases it can introduce
an annoying AC hum (in the case of audio), it can throw off a measurement from a sensor,
or it can cause an actuator to misbehave. Cheap wall plug-in-type power supplies
(covered in <<Chapter_5>>) can sometimes exhibit a significant amount of ripple. Of course,
the ideal solution would be to use a better power supply, but sometimes you just have to work
with whatever is on hand.

<<sec-passive_filtering>> describes a basic single-pole low-pass RC filter. These are suitable
for use as ripple filters, provided that the current through the filter is relatively low. The
reason is the resistor. Referring to <<low_pass>>, if you use an _R_ with a value of 33 ohms and
a _C_ with a value of 100 μF, you'll get a filter with a cut-off frequency of about 48 Hz. This
is well below the typical 60 Hz AC encountered in the US. Ideally, you would want to keep the
value of R as low as possible, to minimize the voltage drop through the filter and thus reduce
the amount of power the resistor will need to dissapate.

==== Spurious Noise

Spurious noise and transient signals can occur when an unshielded signal line passes to close
to something that is generating a significant electromagnetic field. Solenoids can cause
problems, as can poorly shielded DC motors, transformers, and the wiring of circuits that
might be carrying large amounts of current.

.Power Supply Mystery
****
Once, long ago, I worked as a test engineer for a company that produced switching-mode power
supplies. One model of power supply was routinely failing final quality control (QC) tests,
but the failure happened only when the supply was operating at or near maximum current load.
We tried many things to attempt to isolate and resolve the problem. We investigated the transformer between
the high-voltage and low-voltage sides of the supply (see <<Chapter_5>> for
an overview of what's inside a switching-mode power supply). We checked out the opto-coupler that provided
the voltage level feedback to the high-voltage oscillator. We looked at every
possibility, but nothing seemed to be wrong. The supplies simply failed and shut themselves
down at high load levels when they should have continued to run.

After exhausting everything we could think of, someone noticed that a wire that connected
one part of the low-voltage circuit to another section happened to be routed neatly under the
transformer. Because the units operated at about 20 KHz, the transformer wasn't very large,
and it was also unshielded. Just on a hunch, we moved the wire out from under the transformer
and the unit behaved flawlessly. The wire, which happened to be the voltage sense line for
the feedback circuit, was picking up the field from the transformer and inductively
coupling the 20 KHz signal into the feedback circuit. Moving the wire solved the problem.
****

Logic devices can also introduce switching transients onto a DC power supply line, and for
this reason, TTL-type logic typically employs small ceramic capacitors, with values of 0.01
and 0.1 μF commonly seen in circuits that operate at 50 MHz or less. These are also called
_bypass capacitors_, and they are physically mounted close the IC and are connected between
the Vcc (V+) pin and ground. http://bit.ly/an-363[Fairchild Semiconductor application note AN-363] discusses power supplies, noise, and decoupling topics in logic circuits. 

An arrangement of diodes called a _diode clamp_ can be used to limit the voltage levels of
transient spikes on the input of a circuit, as shown in <<diode_clamp>>. The idea here
is that the forward voltage drops of D1 and D2, and D3 and D4, are summed, and since a
typical silicon diode has a drop of about 0.7V, the diodes will not conduct until a spike
exceeds 1.4V, either positive or negative.

[[diode_clamp]]
.Simple input protection with a diode clamp circuit
image::images/pect_aa64.png[align="center"]

The _R_ in the circuit shown in <<diode_clamp>> is there to act as a current limiter, just in case the
diodes are forward biased with enough current to damage them. The value of _R_ should be
high enough to prevent damage to the diode but low enough so as not to introduce a large
voltage drop. If the input needs to have a greater range than +/– 1.4V, then Zener diodes
might be a better choice. Finally, while the diode clamp circuit can prevent damage to
components in the subsequent circuit, it still doesn't eliminate all of the spike. A
capacitor can be used to smooth out the remains of the transient signal, but the ideal
solution is to find the source of the transients and eliminate them.

==== RF Noise and RFI

If you suspect you might have an RFI problem, you should check to make sure that
antenna cables are shielded, low-level signal lines are either shielded or employ twisted pair
wiring (or both), and the shield grounds really are connected to ground. Mounting sensitive
circuits in a grounded metal enclosure is also good.

When it comes to RFI, ground means a solid connection to the earth ground return. The negative
terminal on a battery is not ground, and a power supply may, or may not, tie the negative
terminal to ground. A wall power supply with only two outlet prongs and no ground pin will have
a floating negative, whereas a bench power supply will typically have a terminal specifically
for ground. If a device is operating such that it has no reference to real ground, it is
effectively floating, and it will be susceptible to strong RFI and other noise. Connecting
it to a real ground provides the return path needed to shunt the noise away.

You can also use an RC or RLC filter to block unwanted RF. An inductor will exhibit a higher
reactance to high frequencies than to lower ones, and something as simple as a ferrite bead or
a small choke (like the one shown in <<rfi_choke>>) can block RFI on a DC
signal line. An RC low-pass filter like the circuit shown in <<low_pass>> can also be used
to shunt unwanted high-frequency signals to ground.

Note that putting a filter on a signal line that is carrying something other than a slowly
changing DC level or a low-frequency signal can cause unwanted side effects with the signal
itself. A filter can distort the waveform of square waves and pulses, resulting in increased
rise and fall times with an RC filter, and ringing with a choke or RLC filter. Basically, any
signal with a fast rise time will be impacted by the filter. An AC signal (such as AC
power or audio) will experience a phase shift, and in the case of an audio signal, some of
the high-frequency harmonics might be supressed if the cut-off frequency for the filter is
low enough.

=== Recommended Reading and Further Exploration

This appendix is just a high-level summary of the very deep field of electronics. The
texts listed in <<Appendix_D>> contain much more information, and I suggest that you
look there to seek additional knowledge. I've listed some of the texts here that I feel are
particularly relevant to the topics contained in this appendix.

_The Art of Electronics_ by Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill and _Electronics_ by Allan Hambley
both cover all of the topics presented in this appendix. _The Electrical Engineering Handbook_
(Richard Dorf, Ed.) is a valuable reference that packs in a lot of detailed information, but it
is mostly advanced material and can be a bit cryptic in places. Another text, written at a more
introductory level, can help you make sense of what you might find is the _The Electrical Engineering Handbook_.

If you want to learn to work with op amps, Walter G. Jung's _IC Op-Amp Cookbook_ is a good place to start. In addition to the theory (which is also covered in other texts), this book
contains many interesting example circuits, all of which can be assembled on a solderless
breadboard if you want to work with them.

The _ARRL Handbook_, an official publication of the American Radio Relay League, is my own
go-to book when I want to find some information about RLC circuits and antennas. The _Radio Handbook_ by William I. Orr is another favorite of mine. Both of these books are packed with
hands-on how-to projects, and although most of the projects and circuits are oriented
toward radio communications, they are treasure troves of information about inductors, tuned
circuits, and high-frequeny electronics in general.

You can also find massive amounts of information free on the Internet. Some of what you find
might not be entirely complete or totally accurate, but for the most part, enough eyes have
been on it that the errors tend to get corrected. If I feel too lazy to pull down a book and
elect instead to use Google to find something, I always make it a point to find more than one source
and compare them.
