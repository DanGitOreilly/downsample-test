[[Chapter_2]] 
== Fasteners and Adhesives

Creating something new often entails attaching something to something else, and
modifying something to adapt it to another purpose can entail attaching things
where nothing was attached before. Then there's the issue of making sure things
will stay attached. Fasteners and fastening techniques are key to creating reliable
attachments, or building a solid, reliable chassis and enclosure for a circuit or
electro-mechanical device.((("fasteners"))) As a prelude to the upcoming chapters on tools and their
uses, this chapter presents some of the more common hardware and adhesives used to
fasten two or more things together. In <<Chapter_16>>, we'll look at enclosures and
other packaging topics and see how fasteners and adhesives are used.

Fasteners come in a range of types and sizes. Some, such as screws and bolts, are
familiar to just about everyone. Other types, such as rivets, are not as common but
are widely used in a variety of applications. Still other types are designed for
specialized applications. But regardless of the type or size, all fasteners are
intended to do just what their name implies: fasten something to something else.

Although you might first think of nuts, bolts, and screws,((("bolts"))) a fastener isn't always
a metallic part. Some reusable snap-on plastic fasteners are available for use with
cardboard materials and are excellent for building disposable toys and play sets
for children (among other applications), and screws and bolts are available in
various nonmetallic materials, such as nylon, Teflon, wood, and ceramics.

Note that the word _fasteners_ does not exclude things((("fasteners", "adhesives")))((("adhesives"))) like adhesives (i.e.,
glues, silicon rubber, and other chemical compounds), and this chapter also includes
a brief discussion of the various types of adhesives available. Adhesives are a
handy way to attach things, and if done correctly, the bond is as strong and
reliable as those made with screws or rivets. The concept of fastening can even
be extended to include brazing, welding, and soldering, but this chapter won't
cover those topics. Soldering is covered in <<Chapter_4>> and elsewhere in this
book. Brazing (a technique like a form of high-temperature soldering using an
oxy-acetylene torch) and welding are art forms unto themselves, and there are
numerous excellent reference and how-to books available. Also, many community
colleges and vocational schools offer classes in both techniques.

=== Screws and Bolts

Various standards describe threaded fasteners, but there is no generally
accepted definitive distinction((("fasteners", "screws and bolts"))) between a _screw_ and a _bolt_.((("screws and bolts", "differences between")))((("bolts", "screws versus"))) Some sources
define the difference on the basis of how the part is used, with bolts being
mounted through something and tightened with a nut, and screws being inserted
into a part with preformed threads or cutting their own threads as they are driven
into position (_self-tapping_ screws).((("self-tapping screws"))) Size also matters for naming threaded
fasteners, with small parts often referred to as screws and larger pieces
called bolts.

In any case, both bolts and screws use a spiral thread cut or pressed into a rod
(usually metal but nylon, plastic, and wood have been used as well) to exert
an axial force, which in turn is applied to hold two or more things
in a fixed relationship to one another.

[[distinguishing_bolts_from_screws]]
.Distinguishing bolts from screws
****
The apparent ambiguity in the designation of a fastener as either a bolt or a
screw is reflected in the official publication http://bit.ly/bolts-screws[ICP013, "Distinguishing Bolts from Screws"] from the US Customs and Border Protection division of the Department of Homeland Security. This document attempts to provide some guidance regarding how to determine whether a
fastener is a bolt or a screw, but in the end, it still basically comes down to
size and usage.

As the document puts it: "if it doesn't meet the primary criteria (and of course,
if it doesn't conform to a fastener industry standard for a bolt), then it
probably is a screw." In this case, the "primary criteria" is that a bolt is big
and used with a nut, whereas a screw is small and not used with a nut. Except in
those cases where a screw might be used with a nut (a machine screw). Or it's a
really big bolt with a sharp tip that can cut its own threads. It gets confusing
sometimes.
****

<<various_screws_and_bolts>> shows a sample of the various kinds of screws and
bolts that are available. Just bear in mind that what might be a screw in one
context could also be referred to as a bolt in another. This book will apply
the terms _screw_ and _bolt_ based on the general criteria of size and usage stated
previously.

The variety of available screw types is staggering, and <<various_screws_and_bolts>> shows just a small sample.((("screws and bolts", "varieties of"))) Fortunately, you don't need
to be familiar with every type to make sensible choices; nor do you need to have
a stockroom with stacks of containers full of fasteners to do useful work.

You can generally do most of the necessary fastener work you might encounter
with a selection of((("fasteners", "screws and bolts", "suggested inventory of screws")))((("screws and bolts", "suggested inventory of screws, washers, and nuts"))) machine screws in sizes 2, 4, 6, and 8, with a selection
of lengths for each gauge, ranging from 1/4 inch long to 2 inches. A list of
suggested sizes and types of machine screws to have on hand is shown in
<<suggested_inventory_of_screws>>.((("nuts", "suggested inventory of")))((("washers", "suggested inventory of"))) The following section examines common
gauge sizes in detail.

If you purchase the suggested hardware in <<suggested_inventory_of_screws>>
as stainless steel parts in boxes of 100 each, you'll spend between $2.25 to
$6.50 per box, and 14 small boxes don't take up much room at all. Also be
sure to get nuts, flat washers, and locking washers for each size.
<<washers_section>> discusses the various types of
washers that are available. Of course, you can always just buy small quantities
of what you need from a well-stocked hardware store, but you'll pay less
per piece by buying parts by the box.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
One of the best ways to become familiar with what fasteners are available and how they
are used is to disassemble some electronic devices and observe what was used
to hold things together (and, as a bonus, you might find some interesting
bits to use in your own projects). You will find everything from cap head to
Phillips, UTS/ANSI and metric, self-tapping types for both plastic and metal, and
even some odd-looking things with star-shaped drive holes or even three slots
(_Y_ or _tri-wing_ types, popular with some Asian manufacturers). If you have
a military or industrial surplus outlet nearby, these can be a goldmine for
hardware.
=====================================================================

==== Screw and Bolt Sizes

Fortunately, unless ((("fasteners", "screws and bolts", "sizes of")))((("screws and bolts", "sizes of")))you have a specific need to use an uncommon type of screw
or bolt, you can do almost everything with five or so different sizes.

The Unified Thread System (UTS) commonly used in the US defines screws in
terms of both diameter and thread pitch.((("UTS (Unified Thread System)")))((("Unified Thread System (UTS)"))) The UTS is controlled by ANSI, the
American National Standards Institute, ((("ANSI (American National Standards Institute)", "UTS and bolt and screw sizes")))and throughout this book, I'll use UTS
and ANSI interchangeably when referring to bolt and screw sizes other than
metric. Typical sizes encountered in electronics include diameter gauges of
2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Common thread pitches include 40, 32, and 24. ((("pitch (threads)")))The _pitch_
refers to the number of threads per unit of length in inches. So, a UTS screw
or bolt size is defined ((("gauge-pitch")))as _gauge-pitch_ (e.g., 4-40 or 6-32).
<<uts_machine_screw_sizes>> lists some common UTS screw and bolt sizes. The
fractional diameter is the nearest value.((("UTS (Unified Thread System)", "screw and bolt sizes")))

[[uts_machine_screw_sizes]]
.UTS/ANSI machine screw diameter sizes
[width="100%",cols="^1,^1,^1",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|============================================
| Gauge | Diameter (inches) | Decimals
|   0   |   1/16    |  0.06
|   1   |   5/64    |  0.07
|   2   |   3/32    |  0.08
|   3   |   7/64    |  0.09
|   4   |   7/64    |  0.11
|   5   |   1/8     |  0.12
|   6   |   9/64    |  0.13
|   8   |   5/32    |  0.16
|  10   |   3/16    |  0.19
|  12   |   7/32    |  0.21
|  14   |   1/4     |  0.24
|============================================

Just because a gauge size is defined in <<uts_machine_screw_sizes>>,
that doesn't necessarily mean that hardware in that size can be easily
purchased. Fasteners in sizes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are readily available.
You can find other sizes (#1, for example) if you're willing to look
hard enough, but if you need to special-order a gauge, a supplier won't
be too interested unless you are willing to commit to purchasing a large
quantity of the parts. Stick to the common sizes if at all possible.
It's much easier that way.

Also be aware that with sizes of 1/4 inch or larger, the parts are often specified
in diameter-pitch nomenclature,((("diameter-pitch (screw and bolt sizes)"))) rather than gauge-pitch. In other words,
while saying you want to use a 14-20 is technically correct, you may find
that 1/4-20 is how the parts are stocked at the distributor or hardware store.

You should keep in mind that the gauge size numbers used with machine
screws and bolts are also used with self-tapping screws, both sheet metal
and wood. Be aware, however, that the actual diameter of a part can vary
somewhat from the ideal value given in <<uts_machine_screw_sizes>>. The
amount of variance depends on the tolerances applied by the manufacturer
and the process used to create the threads, but it is generally no more
than +/– 0.01 inches. This is important to remember when sizing holes and
selecting drill bits, as discussed in <<Chapter_4>>.

In the metric-speaking world (which is almost everywhere outside of the US)
a large range of metric screw and bolt types is available.((("metric system", "screw and bolt sizes"))) These are defined
in the international standard ISO 68-1, and the ISO 262 standard specifies a
number of predefined sizes.((("ISO 68-1, and ISO 262 standard (screw and bolt sizes)"))) Based on the standards, a metric screw with a
shaft diameter of 1 mm may have a coarse thread of 0.25 mm or a fine thread
of pass:[<span class="keep-together">0.2 mm.</span>] So, to specify a 1 mm screw with a coarse thread, you would use
M1x0.25.

The remainder of this book will largely stick to UTS/ANSI nomenclature except
when discussing things like tapping and clearance holes, but generally,
everything you might say about using a UTS screw or bolt also applies to its
metric equivalent.

[TIP]
====
It seems inevitable that eventually the entire world, the US included, will
go to the metric system.((("metric system", "world-wide adoption of"))) In industry this has already begun, with many US
manufacturers shifting to metric parts to accommodate a global market and the
use of parts and subassemblies from foreign suppliers. If you want to employ
some "future-proofing" into your designs, you might want to consider learning
how to work with metric parts, and metric units of measurement in general.

[[drive_types]]
==== Screw and Bolt Drive Types

The two most commonly encountered screw drive((("drive types (screws and bolts)")))((("screws and bolts", "drive types")))((("fasteners", "screws and bolts", "drive types"))) types are slotted and Phillips.((("slotted screw drivers")))((("Phillips screw drivers")))
<<screw_and_bolt_drive_styles>> shows the drive types you might regularly encounter,
but other specialty types are also in use. These are the common names; other names are also encountered, such as cross for Phillips, and Robertson for the square drive. Browsing through the website or
catalog of a supplier such as McMaster-Carr, Microfasteners, or AmazonSupply
(formerly SmallParts) can be very informative.

[[screw_and_bolt_drive_styles]]
[role="float-top wide"] 
.Screw and bolt drive styles
image::images/pect_0202.png[align="center"]

Some types of fasteners are available with a six-sided (hex) hole for use
with a hex wrench (also called a hex key or((("Allen wrench"))) an Allen wrench).((("hex socket drives"))) These _hex socket_ types
are usually found with button and cap head styles (see  <<screw_and_bolt_head_styles>>) and are common in robotics and in scientific
and metrology equipment such as interferometers, optical spectrometers, and
telescopes. A hex socket drive allows for greater torque without tool slippage,
which is a problem with both slot and Phillips drives.

Larger bolts often have a hex head suitable for use with a socket tool (i.e.,
the entire head of the bolt is the drive), and small sizes in this style are
also available. The large sizes will be familiar to anyone who has ever worked
on an automobile, and the small sizes can sometimes be found in scientific
and military-grade equipment.

A small hex head part can be difficult to drive without a special socket wrench
made specifically to seat flush around the head. Most common sockets sold at
auto supply and home improvement centers will not work reliably, because they have
a slightly rounded edge that will prevent the socket from fully seating on the
sides of the head. The tool will likely slip and damage the head of the fastener.
<<Chapter_4>> discusses how to modify a socket to fit flush on a small hex
head fastener.

If you elect to use a hex head screw or bolt, it is worth bearing in mind that
while the part can be tightened (torqued) to a greater degree without tool
slippage (or tool breakage) than a Phillips or a hex socket head part, it can
be awkward to use in tight places where the socket to drive the screw or bolt
won’t easily fit. In other words, consider the tool that will need to be used
to deal with the fastener in its eventual location.

Drive types such as tri-wing, Y, Torx, and other((("security", "special screw and bolt drive types")))((("tri-wing, Y, and Torx drive types"))) security variations are
intended to discourage unauthorized access. They require special tools made
expressly for that drive type, and the tools usually aren't available at
the local home improvement center. Avoid them if at all possible.

[TIP]
====
You can defeat a security Torx or hex socket type drive by carefully knocking
out the small pin-like column in the center of the drive hole using a pin punch
and a ball-peen hammer. Alternatively, you can sometimes drill out the security pin
with a good drill press if you first securely clamp down the work piece and use
a drill bit not much larger than the security pin. Then again, if you expect to
work with these types of fasteners on a regular basis, the tools to deal with them
aren't that expensive and you can find them on eBay.
====

[[screw_and_bolt_head_styles]]
==== Screw and Bolt Head Styles

<<common_screw_and_bolt_head_types>> shows some ((("head styles (screws and bolts)")))((("fasteners", "screws and bolts", "head styles")))((("screws and bolts", "head styles")))common head types for screws and
bolts.((("hex head bolts"))) The hex head is typically found on bolts (larger than common screws), and
the button and cap head types typically have a hex socket and are used with a
hex wrench.((("cap-head screws"))) Notice that the cap head
is shown with knurling, which allows for hand-tightening if the head is large
enough or your fingers are small enough. The other head types can have either
a slot or Phillips drive, and even a hex socket drive variation is available for
the ((("oval-head screws")))((("flat-head screws")))flat and oval head styles.

[[common_screw_and_bolt_head_types]]
[role="float-bottom wide"]
.Common screw and bolt head types
image::images/pect_0203.png[align="center"]

The round and pan head styles are most common around the home.((("pan-head screws")))((("round-head screws"))) Woodworkers
routinely employ flat-head wood screws to keep the screw head flush with the
surface of the wood. Consumer electronics tend to use a lot of flat-head
machine screws and self-tapping types, again to keep things smooth and flush.

Be aware that the flat and oval head types require ((("countersunk holes")))a countersunk hole to seat
correctly. These are typically used in situations that require low-profile (or
flush, in the case of the flat head types) screws or bolts. <<Chapter_4>> covers drilling a countersunk hole, but basically, it involves creating a
hole in the material, larger than the hole for the shaft of the screw, for the
screw head to seat into.

==== Selecting Screws and Bolts

Selecting the appropriate screw or bolt for a particular application involves
taking into consideration several factors.((("fasteners", "screws and bolts", "selecting")))((("screws and bolts", "selecting"))) If you want to fasten a plastic back
onto a plastic case, a self-tapping screw would do the job.((("self-tapping screws", "situations for use"))) The back plate of
a metal chassis box is usually fastened with self-tapping sheet metal screws.
The screws used to mount things to a chassis, panel, or other surface can be
8-32, 6-32, or 4-40, depending on the size and mass of what is being mounted.

As a general rule of thumb, the larger the screw or bolt, the more load it can
bear.((("loads (machine screws)"))) Small screws (#2, for example) are fine for lightweight tasks, but a
larger #6 or #8 screw should be considered for items or situations where the
screw must resist a force (as with hinges or attaching a metal panel). Also,
the use of multiple screws or bolts can increase strength and reliability, but
at the cost of extra weight and expense. Without knowing the type of materials
being used and the forces expected, it's impossible for me to give specific recommendations
for maximum loads, but <<machine_screw_loads>> can serve as a rough
guide.((("screws and bolts", "selecting", "loads")))

[[machine_screw_loads]]
.Machine screw clamp loads
[width="100%",cols="^1,^1",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|============================================
|Size   | Clamp load
|4-40   | 200
|6-32   | 350
|8-32   | 500
|10-24  | 700
|1/4-20 | 700
|============================================

_Clamp load_ is ((("clamp load")))the amount of load applied to a bolted joint to hold the parts together
and avoid relative motion (shear slippage).((("shear slippage"))) In <<machine_screw_loads>> this is
a maximum de-rated value derived from various references, and it assumes the lowest grade
of part. It does not take into account any additional stresses that may be placed on
the fastener.

In general, parts with a nut tend to resist pull-out (axial failure) better than screws
in a tapped hole, but the amount of the screw's threads engaged by the nut or the
inside threads of a tapped hole plays a significant role. Likewise, the material the
screw or bolt is used with has a big effect on the ability of the part to resist
pull-out. Consider the case of a #4 stainless steel screw in a tapped hole in a piece
of soft 1/10-inch (10-gauge) aluminum. Odds are, the inside threads in the hole in the aluminum will
probably fail before the screw itself does, particularly if the hole was threaded using
a 50% thread instead of a 75% cut. See <<Chapter_4>> for more on threads and how to make
them.

Shear strength is another consideration.((("screws and bolts", "selecting", "shear strength")))((("shear strength", "screws and bolts)"))) If a screw or bolt is used to attach two pieces
that may have a tendency to move parallel to each another, then there's a distinct risk that
the fastener can be sheared off between the pieces. One way to compensate for this is to
use the largest screw or bolt size possible. Another approach is to set hardened
steel alignment pins into the pieces so that when they are mated, the pins will help take
the stress if the pieces shift.

MIL-HDBK-60 from the US government contains a lot of useful information about
threaded fasteners, along with definitions and formulas for various applications.((("fasteners", "reference guides for")))((("MIL-HDBK-60"))) You can download it for free at http://bit.ly/fasten-hndbk[EverySpec]. Fastenal also provides a http://bit.ly/tech-ref-guide[good online fastener guide]. Although it mainly addresses large bolts and nuts, the information can be easily
scaled down for smaller fasteners.

The drive type is another important selection criteria.((("screws and bolts", "selecting", "drive type")))((("drive types (screws and bolts)")))((("Phillips screw drivers")))((("hex drives"))) The two most common choices are
Phillips and hex (i.e., Allen) drives.((("Allen drives")))((("Phillips drives"))) When selecting a Phillips drive, be careful not to
get confused with a ((("JIS drive type")))JIS cross-drive type screw head, which looks a lot like a Phillips
but doesn't behave the same way (it won't "cam out," for example). See <<Chapter_4>>
for more on the JIS drive type.

Hex drives are popular in aerospace sub-systems, military gear, and scientific instruments.
Generally, you'll find hex drive screws and bolts in applications where there is a need to
apply a significant and specific amount of torque to a fastener. A Phillips drive part will
determine how much maximum torque you can apply by virtue of its design, while a hex drive will
not stop you from twisting a hex wrench into two peices if you're not careful (or shearing
the head off a bolt or screw). For this reason, hex drive fasteners are often installed
with a torque wrench.

[TIP]
====
Never use a slotted-head screw or bolt if you can avoid it.((("slotted screw drives"))) Screwdrivers tend
to slip out of the slot, and it doesn’t take much to damage the slot to the
point where it is unusable. For this reason, the Phillips drive was invented
about 80 years ago to minimize damage to fasteners by "camming out" when the
screw stalled at maximum tightness. A Phillips or hex socket drive is a much
better choice than a single-slot part.
====

Use a screw that is just long enough to do the job;((("self-tapping screws"))) self-tapping screws can cause damage
if they drive too far, especially in the case of plastic self-tapping types. Holes that
are sized and tapped for a particular screw, such as the mounting holes in the aluminum
frame of a hard disk drive, will accept only a screw of a specific maximum length. A
screw that is too long either won't drive in completely, or it might drive through into
something that it will damage (such as a circuit board in the path of the screw).

When using a nut, also try to use the shortest possible screw.((("nuts", "selecting right screw or bolt for"))) A screw or bolt that
protrudes out beyond the nut can interfere with other components and might get bent. A
bent screw with a nut on it can be very difficult to remove gracefully without resorting
to a cutting tool of some type.

[[washers_section]]
==== Washers

Washers are essential when using fasteners to create a reliable load-bearing
mounting point and help prevent the screw from working itself out and coming
loose over time.((("fasteners", "screws and bolts", "washers")))((("screws and bolts", "washers")))((("washers")))((("flat washers"))) A flat washer under the head of the screw or bolt helps to
distribute the force applied by the screw. With metal, a washer slightly wider
than the head of the screw is usually sufficient. If you are attaching to something
thin or soft, such as polystyrene plastic, use a larger flat washer to help
spread out the stress on the material. The same reasoning applies to soft
materials like wood.

<<washers_figure>> shows some of the ((("washers", "varieties of")))available washer styles, and <<using_washers>>
shows the typical assembly order for a screw and nut with washers.

[[washers_figure]]
.Various types of washers

[[using_washers]]
.Using washers
image::images/pect_0205.png[width=300,align="center"]

A flat washer is also sometimes used as a spacer, although it is not a good
idea to use a stack of washers to try to compensate for a screw or bolt that
is too long to begin with. Occasionally an assembled bolt stack will include
a flat washer under the lock washer beneath the nut.((("lock washers"))) Although this does
somewhat reduce the effectiveness of the lock washer, it also helps to prevent
marring the underlying surface when the lock washer "bites" into the material.

A lock washer helps prevent a nut from becoming loose.((("outer-tooth lock washers")))((("inner-tooth lock washers")))((("split-ring lock washers"))) These types of washers
come in three basic styles: split-ring, inner-tooth, and outer-tooth.
<<split-ring_lock_washer>> shows how a split-ring lock washer works.

[[split-ring_lock_washer]]
[role="float-top wide"]
.Split-ring lock washer
image::images/pect_0206_wide_mod.png[]

The edges of the split are bent slightly so that the nut will move over them
smoothly when turned in the tightening direction, but the sharp edges will catch
(or bite) on both the nut and the underlying surface if the nut moves in the
loosening direction. This isn't enough to prevent the removal of the nut, but
it is enough friction to help keep the nut secure. Be careful not to overtighten
a split-ring lock washer, as it can be pressed flat, effectively disabling
the locking capability of the washer.

The inner- and outer-tooth washers work in basically the same way, except that
with these types, each tooth is bent slightly to bite into the nut and surface
material ((("toothed lock washers")))if it starts to loosen. <<toothed_lock_washers>> shows a selection of
toothed washers. Toothed washers are often used with soft materials, such as
plastic or sheet aluminum. Toothed washers are also used for establishing a
ground connection, as the teeth can cut through paint or an anodized finish
into the underlying metal.

[[toothed_lock_washers]]
.Toothed lock washers
image::images/pect_0207.png[width="500",align="center"]

When you are using a screw in a pre-threaded hole, there is, of course, no nut to lock,
so the lock washer is placed under the head of the screw. A flat washer may
also be used to protect the underlying surface, if necessary, but the smooth
flat washer may reduce the effectiveness of the lock washer.

[[self_tapping_screws_ch02]]
==== Self-Tapping Screws

Sometimes it makes sense to let a screw cut its own ((("screws and bolts", "self-tapping screws")))((("self-tapping screws")))((("fasteners", "screws and bolts", "self-tapping screws")))threads, and that is just
what a self-tapping screw is designed to do. If you've ever worked with wood
or wallboard (sheet-rock), you've probably encountered a self-tapping screw.
A self-tapping wood screw can cut its own threads as it is driven into place
in a soft material such as wood.

<<self-tapping_fasteners>> shows a selection of different self-tapping screws.

[[self-tapping_fasteners]]
.Self-tapping screws

Plastic is another material that works well with self-tapping fasteners, and
they can also be used with soft or thin sheet metal. The small enclosures and
electronics chassis sold by companies such as Hammond and LMB often use
self-tapping sheet-metal screws to affix covers and panels to the main box or
chassis.

As handy as they might appear, you should avoid self-tapping fasteners if
possible. ((("self-tapping screws", "avoiding, reasons for")))If you are working with something already built with self-tapping
screws, sometimes you can't avoid them, but once a self-tapping screw goes
in and comes out, it will almost never go back in as securely as it did the
first time. This is especially true of sheet metal, because the original hole in
the metal will be deformed by the screw when it is first installed. <<Chapter_4>>
describes a handy trick you can use when reinstalling a self-tapping screw.

[[Rivets_ch02]]
=== Rivets

Rivets are commonly used to fasten sheet material, such((("fasteners", "rivets")))((("rivets"))) as the aluminum
skin sections of aircraft, fiberglass panels on a golf cart, and aluminum
canoes. With suitable washers or purpose-made rivets, rivets can also be used
to attach sheet plastic to a metal framework.

It is interesting to note that at one time (about 100 years ago),
rivets--in the form of large red-hot chunks of metal shaped like a threadless
bolt--were used to build the frameworks of skyscrapers, bridges, and the
_Titanic_. In fact, until the widespread acceptance of arc welding and other
modern methods of attaching one piece of metal to another, rivets and large
bolts were the primary fasteners for large structures.

In electronics applications, rivets come in handy ((("rivets", "in electonics applications")))for creating small metal
enclosures, attaching a bracket to something like, say, a metal can for use
as a 2.45 GHz antenna, or even attaching a small metal enclosure to a section
of metal pipe (like a light-beam sensor or sender on a chain-link fence post).

The type of rivet most commonly used for electronics work is relatively small,
about the size ((("small blind rivets")))of a #6 screw. <<small_blind_rivets>> shows some of the sizes((("blind rivet tool")))
available. <<blind_rivet_tool>> shows an example of the tool used to install
rivets.

The items shown in <<small_blind_rivets>> are ((("blind rivets")))so-called _blind rivets_, which
means that they are designed to be installed from one side of the work without
requiring someone with another tool to apply pressure on the opposite side.
They are sometimes also called _pop rivets_, after((("pop rivets"))) the brand name POP
originally used for these products.

Blind rivets are available in a variety of head styles, including domed, flat,
flush, and countersunk types. They also come in a range of sizes, lengths, and
materials.

Blind rivets are installed with a tool that pulls a metal rod through the
rivet body to cause the rivet to expand in a hole. The tool then trims off
the excess length of rod flush with the exposed seat of the rivet. <<Chapter_4>>
covers riveting tools and how to use them. <<Chapter_16>> discusses how blind
rivets can be used to fabricate electronics enclosures or modify existing
equipment or devices.

=== Adhesives and Bonding

Another way to fasten two (or more) things is with adhesives.((("fasteners", "adhesives")))((("adhesives"))) Numerous types
are available, ranging from ((("cyanoacrylates (super-glue)")))((("super-glue")))cyanoacrylates (sometimes called "super-glue"),
to single- and multi-part epoxies,((("epoxies"))) to silicon rubber formulations like the
adhesive used to glue the heatshield tiles onto the space shuttle. Adhesives
are a science unto themselves, and some companies specialize in nothing
but adhesives for special applications.

If you think you want or need to use an adhesive, it would be wise to do some
research and see what is available. If nothing else, just reading the packages
at the hardware store can be informative. When you are applying an adhesive, a pair of
latex or nitrile gloves can save your hands (but make sure the adhesive won't
attack the gloves!), and a wooden popsicle stick or medical tongue depressor
can easily be trimmed with a sharp knife to make a disposable spreading and
mixing tool.

[[adhesive_types]]
==== Glues, Epoxies, and Solvents

Water-based glues work by creating a rigid matrix of linked chemical bonds in
the adhesive material between two parts to be attached.((("fasteners", "adhesives", "glues, epoxies, and solvents")))((("water-based glues")))((("glues")))((("adhesives", "glues, epoxies, and solvents"))) Generally speaking,
when the glue is "wet" it is in a liquid or semiliquid form, and the molecules
in the glue can move and slide around quite easily. Wet glue has very little
internal cohesive strength. It also has the ability to flow into the microscopic
pits, bumps, and pores of the parts it is applied to. Some examples of water-based
glues are the common white glue found in school classrooms or the wood glues used
by pass:[<span class="keep-together">carpenters.</span>]

For a water-based adhesive to form a tight bond, it needs to interface with the
parts being bonded. With materials like wood or paper, this isn't a problem,
since these are porous materials. Water-based adhesives usually don't work well with nonporous
materials such as plastic or metal.

When a glue "dries" through evaporation or chemical reaction, the molecules in the glue can no longer
move, and the internal cohesive force increases. Some types of glues also shrink,
thereby pulling the glued parts closer to one another, while others expand
slightly. The main point, however, is that the glue forms a hard interface between
two parts that both adheres to the parts and is internally cohesive so it won't
break apart under normal stress.

An _epoxy_ is a type of adhesive that utilizes a chemical reaction (curing) to create((("epoxies", "defined")))
internal cohesive bonds. Epoxy adhesives are based on an epoxy resin, which may be
any of a number of compounds from what is called the _epoxide functional group_.((("epoxide functional group"))) The
word _epoxy_ actually refers to the cured form of epoxy resin.

An _epoxy resin_ is a type of((("epoxy resin"))) polymer that consists of chains of molecules. When the
resin reacts with a hardener agent, either contained within the resin itself or
applied as an additive, the reaction causes a chemical reaction involving cross-linking
that is referred((("curing"))) to as _curing_.

Epoxy adhesives come in various forms.((("epoxies", "curing"))) There are one-part formulations that use
light (typically UV) to start the curing action, while others work on contact with
the air. A two-part epoxy consists of a resin and a hardener. These are mixed just
prior to use. The shelf life of two-part epoxy is long, often on the order of
years. Once the parts are mixed there is a period of time, typically between 5 and 30 minutes,
when the epoxy can be worked before it starts to set and become too stiff to
manipulate. Full curing can take up to 24 hours, depending on the formulation.

There is a vast range of applications for epoxy-based adhesives, and more for
non-adhesive applications.((("epoxies", "applications for"))) Epoxies are known for excellent adhesion, good chemical
and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties, and excellent
electrical insulating properties.((("bonding", "using epoxies"))) With the appropriate formulation, epoxies can
be used to bond materials such as metal, glass, wood, ceramics, plastics, and
other resin-based materials (e.g., fiberglass and carbon-fiber materials). Some
types of epoxies feature high thermal insulation, while other types offer thermal
conductivity combined with high electrical resistance.

Unlike adhesion, _plastic bonding_ is the ((("fasteners", "bonding")))((("plastic bonding")))((("bonding", "plastic bonding")))process of causing two parts to partially
dissolve at the point where they meet, and then allowing that joint to re-harden
so that the two different parts actually become one. This applies only to plastics,
and it is the plastic equivalent of welding two metal parts to one another. Bonding
can be accomplished using heat generated by focused ultrasonic vibrations, applied
by a heated metal tool, or chemically using a solvent. Here we will be looking at
the chemical approach to plastic bonding; and if you have ever built a plastic model
car or airplane or assembled PVC plumbing or conduit, then you are probably
already familiar with plastic bonding. The ever-popular "clamshell" packaging
is an example of ultrasonic thermal bonding, and cheap plastic toys are sometimes
assembled with hot flat-tip tools that press a molded stub down into another
piece and weld the two at that point.

Adhesives that utilize bonding((("adhesives", "utilizing bonding"))) work by attacking and literally melting the plastic
to create a welded connection, and the plastic can react to the solvent very quickly.((("solvents", "used in plastic bonding")))
One chemical of this type is known as((("methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)"))) methyl ethyl ketone, or MEK, also referred to
as butanone.((("butanone"))) It is particularly effective with polystyrene plastics. It also works
with polyvinylchloride (PVC) and clear acrylic plastic. MEK can be purchased in small
amounts at most hardware and home improvement stores. It is typically a thin liquid
that will evaporate rapidly, and it must be used with good ventilation.

==== Working with Wood and Paper

You can glue wood easily using adhesives((("glues", "using with wood and paper")))((("wood", "using adhesives with")))((("adhesives", "working wih wood and paper")))((("fasteners", "adhesives", "working with wood and paper"))) specifically formulated for that purpose,
although you can also use a general-purpose epoxy and get good results if you
are careful and pick the correct one. Depending on how strong you want the
joint to be, and whether or not it needs to be waterproof, you can use standard
white glue, general-purpose glue, or specialty carpenter's wood glue. Even hot
glue will work for some applications.

The same general caveats for wood apply to working with ((("paper", "using adhesives with")))paper in all its various
forms. A wide range of paper products is available, from heavy poster board to
corrugated cardboard. These are useful for assembling a prototype enclosure or
creating a scale model of something. Common white glue works well with paper
(as any creative child can testify), and most wood glues will also work. Hot
glue is popular with the arts-and-crafts crowd because it adheres reasonably
well in the short term and is easy to apply.

Although it might tempting because of its convenience, resist the urge to use
hot glue for anything except cardboard, fiberboard, and craft projects. Hot glue
can be very unreliable; it's somewhat brittle when cool, and its adhesive
properties on nonporous surfaces like metal or plastics are rather poor. It's
great for making throwaway holiday decorations, but for long-term applications,
not so much. Hot glue can also deliver some nasty burns if it comes into contact
with bare skin while still in the molten state.

==== Working with Plastic

Plastics are a good place to consider((("fasteners", "adhesives", "working with plastic")))((("plastics", "using adhesives with")))((("adhesives", "working with plastic"))) using adhesives, but you need to be aware
of just what type of plastic you are working with.((("polyethylene", "adhesives and"))) Polyethylene, for example,
is often heat-fusion-bonded to seal different pieces together, as standard
adhesives and resins don't adhere to it very well. If you are working with
something like polystyrene or PVC, you have a number of
adhesive choices available.

[NOTE]
====
There are multiple methods for identifying plastics, ranging from burning a sample
sliver to laboratory spectroscopy.((("plastics", "identifying"))) Another way is to take a sliver or sample piece
and apply the adhesive you want to use. If you are using MEK or a MEK-like
solvent-based adhesive, then the sample will show signs of a reaction with the
adhesive (sagging, melting, deformation, softness, etc.). If it does nothing, then
you will need to consider a different adhesive formulation, like a two-part epoxy.
====

Epoxies are a good choice, provided that the epoxy is formulated for the materials
to be bonded.((("epoxies", "using with plastics"))) The downside to epoxies is that they tend to take some time to
properly cure, so if you are in a hurry, you might want to consider something
else. Also, because plastics are nonporous, the glued joint may be prone to
breaking if it is overstressed by being bent or twisted. If it does break, it
will most likely be at the place where the epoxy meets the material; the epoxy
itself is tough and usually stays intact.

When you're working with polystyrene, PVC, or ABS materials, the best choice is to use
a solvent-type bond (also known as _solvent welding_),((("solvent welding"))) unless there is some compelling
reason not to. If you purchase((("methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)"))) MEK (described in <<adhesive_types>>), you
might want to consider making your own "glue" rather than try to work with the MEK
in its liquid form. To make it thicker and easier to use, you can dissolve some
bits of scrap polystyrene into it. The resulting goo is basically what you
get from a tube of model cement from the hobby store, and it's a whole lot
cheaper, too.

Note that a solvent like MEK won't work with some plastics.((("solvents", "plastics and"))) PEX, for example,
seems to be unaffected by MEK, as is nylon. For these, you'll need to select a
different adhesive, or resort to bolts, nuts, and brackets.

==== Working with Metal

Joining metal can be challenging, because((("adhesives", "working with metal")))((("metal", "using adhesives with")))((("fasteners", "adhesives", "working with metal"))) the smooth, nonporous metal surfaces
don't really offer much for the adhesive to grip. Water-based glues such as
white glue and wood glue won't work, and solvent-based bonding methods are
useless with metal.

Some types of specialty epoxies will grip metal surfaces,((("epoxies", "using with metal"))) if the surfaces
are properly prepared. When using an epoxy to join metal parts, be sure to
follow the manufacturer's directions to the letter. As with plastics, an
epoxy joint with metal parts is susceptible to shear forces. In other words,
it might have good tensile strength, but it can break if twisted or bent.

Another method involves the ((("silicon rubber adhesive")))silicon rubber adhesive mentioned earlier. It
comes in a variety of types and colors, with some types useful for things
like caulking a shower stall, and other grades suitable for use with the
gaskets on automobile engines. Some high-temperature formulations are also
available (such as what was used with the space shuttle). The downside is
that silicon rubber works best for attaching large, flat surfaces. It
doesn't work well for something that is small or narrow, such as when you're trying to glue one plate to another at a right angle.

In reality, the two best methods for attaching metal are to use fasteners
or some kind of welding process. Epoxies come in third, but there is the
issue of shear weakness. Silicon rubber works if there is a lot of surface
area to work with, but otherwise it might not be a good idea.

==== Special-Purpose Adhesives

Be careful when working with cyanoacrylate adhesives.((("cyanoacrylates (super-glue)")))((("glues", "cyanoacrylate")))((("adhesives", "special-purpose")))((("fasteners", "adhesives", "special-purpose"))) These glues work
quickly and can create strong bonds, but they should be used with caution.
Cotton or wool materials can react with cyanoacrylates in an exothermic
reaction, and the heat generated can be high enough to cause a fire to
break out.((("shear strength", "cyanoacrylates"))) Cyanoacrylates also tend to have low shear strength, so
while you might have trouble pulling a bond apart, applying sideways
force will typically break it loose. These adhesives also tend to have
a short shelf life, on the order of a year in an unopened package, and
less than a month after they've been opened.

[[summary_ch02]]
=== Summary

There are numerous ways to attach one thing to another. The best method depends
on the material, the necessary strength, the desired reliability, and how much
effort you want to put into it. Starting with bolts and screws, which are very strong fasteners when used correctly, we moved on to look at rivets, and finally adhesives. We did not cover gas, arc, or spot welding here.

With the information presented in this chapter, you should be able to make
informed decisions about the types of fasteners that are suitable for your
projects, and also be able to identify some of the less common types when
modifying or re-purposing an existing device.

Although this chapter has mentioned in passing some of the tools used, and provided
some warnings about selecting the right tool for a particular fastener, Chapters pass:[<a href="Chapter_3">3</a>] and pass:[<a href="Chapter_4">4</a>] provide further details about tools and their
correct usage. <<Chapter_16>> presents some examples of how to select and use various fastening techniques to create finished pass:[<span class="keep-together">packages.</span>]
