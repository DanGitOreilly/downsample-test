== Switches

Switches are all around us and have been for the past 150 years or so. Early
switches were rather crude things, ((("switches", id="ix_switches")))consisting mainly of one or more _blades_
that could be moved into position((("blades (switches)"))) between two terminals of some sort using a
handle attached to the blade assembly. The old scary movies of the last
century used these as set props for locations like Dr. Frankenstein's lab, and
they can also be seen in old photos of Tesla's and Edison's actual workshops. In fact, they are still in use and are available for purchase. <<knife_blade_switch>>
shows a modern version of this ancient switch type.

Switches have come a long way since they made their first appearances in the
19th century. They are now available in a vast range of styles and types. Some
are incredibly tiny, while others are huge. They can be push activated, sliding, or
rotary. Some have a so-called _toggle_ handle to operate them, whereas others
have a rocker type of operation.((("toggle handle (switches)"))) Some are designed to be operated solely by
a mechanism, rather than by a human being. Still others have built-in lamps
of some sort to let the operator know when a circuit is active or a fault has
occurred. A whole industry has grown up around the design and production of
switches, and many engineers spend their entire careers designing and testing
new types of switches and improving on the designs of older types.

A look at the switches section of the website for a major distributor such as
Digikey or Mouser will reveal a mind-numbing variety to choose from. In this
chapter, we'll look at some of the more commonly used types and pay special
attention to things like physical mounting requirements, connection methods,
current ratings, and durability.

Relays are a type of electromechanical switch, and they are discussed separately
in <<Chapter_10>>. Digital switches are discussed in <<Chapter_11>>. In this chapter,
we'll stick to the old-fashioned mechanical types of switches. These devices are
all around us in a multitude of types and forms, and they probably will be for a long
time to come.

=== One Switch, Multiple Circuits

In its simplest form, a switch controls one circuit with one contact mechanism
by being either ((("toggle switches")))((("switches", "one switch, multiple circuits")))open or closed. <<simple_toggle_mech>> shows a simplified illustration of the internal
components of a typical modern single-contact switch.
This is a toggle switch, covered in more depth in <<switch_types>>.

[[simple_toggle_mech]]
.Simplified diagram of a toggle switch mechanism
image::images/pect_0602.png[align="center",height=180]

The mechanism is simple, consisting of a contactor that can rock into one position
or another. The end of the toggle handle inside the switch is a spring-loaded plunger
(the actuator) that pushes the contactor to the desired position and then holds it
there. As you can see in <<simple_toggle_mech>>, the contact rocker will either allow
current to flow when in the closed position, or it will be open in the opposite
position and no current will flow.

This is a common design in switches that incorporate a spring-loaded mechanism of some
sort. When the switch is closed, it "snaps" closed and stays in that position. Applying
force (via a toggle, rocker, or other means) overcomes the spring tension in the actuator
and allows the switch to snap open and remain open. <<typical_toggle>> shows a typical((("toggle switches", "typical miniature toggle switch")))
commercial miniature toggle switch with this type of mechanism.

[[typical_toggle]]

image::images/pect_0603.png[align="center",height=180]

Some available switches((("circuits", "single switch controlling multiple circuits"))) have two, three, or more internal contacts
operating in parallel, thus allowing a single device to control multiple
circuits simultaneously. In switch terminology, a single contact is called
a _pole_. Each((("poles"))) pole can have one or more positions so that a multi-pole switch
can control multiple circuits. The only real limitations to this concept are
the physical constraints on the switch and the force required to operate it.

If the switch has only one active position (on or off), it is referred to as a
_single-throw_ (ST) type.((("ST (single-throw) switches")))((("single-throw (ST) switches"))) This is the type of switch illustrated in <<simple_toggle_mech>>
and pictured in <<typical_toggle>>. A switch with two active positions (ON-ON) is called((("double-throw (DT) switches")))((("DT (double-throw) switches")))
a _double-throw_ (DT) switch.

An ST switch is like a simple gate, whereas a DT type can route current between two
different paths, A or B. Some varieties of DT switch have a mechanical "neutral" position in between,
which is an ON-OFF-ON type of action.

The contactor (or _contact rocker_) shown((("toggle switches", "contact rocker or pole")))((("contact rocker"))) in <<simple_toggle_mech>> is also called
a _pole_ in switch terminology.((("poles", "single-pole (SP) and double-pole (DP) switches"))) If the switch has one pole, it is a _single-pole_ (SP) type.((("single-pole (SP) switches"))) If it has
two poles, it is referred to as a _double-pole_ (DP) switch.((("double-pole (DP) switches"))) In a DP switch, the poles are
mechanically linked and move in unison, allowing the switch to control two different
circuits at the same time.

ST, DT, SP, and DP functions can be combined to create SPST, DPST, SPDT, and DPDT
switches.((("single-pole single-throw (SPST) switches")))((("SPST (single-pole single-throw) switches")))((("SPDT (single-pole double-throw) switches")))((("single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switches")))((("double-pole single-throw (DPST) switches")))((("double-pole double-throw (DPDT) switches"))) For example, the knife-blade switch shown back in <<knife_blade_switch>> is an SPDT type. <<common_switch_schematics>> shows the schematic representations of the four
common switch pole and position arrangements (note that <<Appendix_B>> covers schematics in detail).((("switches", "schematic symbols for common SP and DP switches")))

[[common_switch_schematics]]
.Schematic symbols for common SP and DP switch types
image::images/pect_0604.png[align="center",height=333]

Notice that a dashed line is used here to indicate that the poles shown in the symbols
are mechanically coupled. A schematic might also use labels, such as S1-A and S1-B, to
denote that a switch has more than one pole, or it could use both methods. The current
trend is to dispense with the dashed line, but you will likely encounter it in
older schematics.

[[switch_types]]
=== Switch Types

In this section, we'll look at toggle, rocker, slide, rotary, pushbutton, and snap-action
switches.((("switches", "types of"))) These cover most of the mechanical switch spectrum, and all are really just
variations on a theme.

==== Toggle

The toggle switch is a common type that comes in a variety of styles. <<heavy_toggle_switch>> shows((("toggle switches")))((("switches", "toggle"))) a heavy-duty
toggle switch (you've already seen a miniature version in <<typical_toggle>>).

[[heavy_toggle_switch]]
.A heavy-duty toggle switch
image::images/pect_0605.png[width=200]

Toggle switches can be even smaller, with a micro form available, as shown in <<micro_toggle_switch>>.
These are useful in applications
where space is limited, but a toggle switch is still needed.

[[micro_toggle_switch]]
.A mico-toggle switch
image::images/pect_0606.png[width=200]

Toggle switches are readily available in SPST, SPDT, DPST, and DPDT forms. They
can also be had in three-pole and four-pole versions.((("toggle switches", "SPST, SPDT, DPST, and DPDT forms"))) It is useful to remember that a
SPDT switch with only the common terminal and one position wired is the same as
a SPST switch.

Yet another variation is the((("toggle switches", "center-off switch (ON-OFF-ON type)")))((("ON-OFF-ON (center-off) switch")))((("center-off switch (ON-OFF-ON)"))) center-off switch (the ON-OFF-ON type mentioned earlier).
In these switches, the internal contacts might be SPDT or DPST, but the toggle handle
has three positions. In the center position, the plunger at the end of the toggle
actuator will settle into a detent in the middle of the contact rocker, leaving the
contact rocker with both ends suspended, and neither of the terminals will be connected.

In some applications, a center OFF with a momentary ON in one of the positions is used for
things like testing a subsystem (momentary ON) and enabling the subsystem (normal ON).
The manufacturer achieves the momentary action by shaping the contact rocker such that it will not
hold the toggle actuator, whereas the regular ON position will. Some designs also
incorporate an internal spring to push the actuator back to the center position when
it is moved to the momentary position and then released.

Toggle switches might not be the flashiest or most futuristic-looking switches,
but they are rugged, easy to use, and ubiquitous. Older styles of common residential
light switches are a type of toggle, as are some of the switches found on the front
panels of musical instrument amplifiers. The control panels of spacecraft like
the _Soyuz_ or the space shuttle contain hundreds of them, and in early computers,
toggles switches were one way to enter a program or data into memory. These days,
new houses are often wired with a type of rocker switch, which we'll look at next.

==== Rocker

A rocker switch employs a plastic or metal piece shaped in a shallow 'V' so that((("switches", "rocker")))((("rocker switches")))
when one end is up, the other is down. In other words, it rocks from one position
to another. Internally, the mechanism is identical or similar to that of a
toggle switch (or perhaps a slide switch, depending on the manufacturer; see <<slide_section>>). <<typical_mini_rocker_switch>> shows a typical miniature rocker switch.((("SPST (single-pole single-throw) switches", "generic SPST miniature rocker switch")))((("rocker switches", "generic SPST miniature rocker switch")))

[[typical_mini_rocker_switch]]
.A generic SPST miniature rocker switch
image::images/pect_0607.png[align="center"]

All that is really different about a rocker switch is the physical means of
changing the internal mechanical state of the switch. Most rocker switches use
a pivoted contact rocker similar to that found in a toggle switch. Also note that
some rocker switches come with built-in lamps. There are neon, LED, and incandescent
bulb types available, and they are commonly encountered in aviation and industrial
controls. As with the toggle switches, some older mainframe and minicomputer systems
made extensive use of rocker switches to enter data into the machine. Also as with toggle switches,
rocker switches can also be found in a center-OFF form, as well as a momentary
action in one or both directions.

[[slide_section]]
==== Slide

Slide switches are a convenient way to select((("switches", "slide")))((("slide switches"))) from more than two circuits. A
small tab or knob slides in a track to move the pole contactor (or contactors)
between positions, and slide switches can have more than one pole. <<typical_slide_switch>>
shows a typical small slide switch with solder eyelets. This particular switch is
designed to be panel-mounted with screws.

[[typical_slide_switch]]
.A typical small slide switch
image::images/pect_0608.png[align="center"]

Other types of slide switches have pin-like legs for mounting on a PCB, as shown
in <<pcb_mount_slide_switch>>.((("printed circuit boards (PCBs)", "PCB-mounted slide switch"))) These are useful for situations where a PCB can be
used to support the switch, and they look a bit neater than a switch with screws.
For a front-panel control, the slide tab protrudes through the panel and the PCB
is mounted behind it to support it.

[[pcb_mount_slide_switch]]
.PCB-mounted slide switch
image::images/pect_0609.png[align="center"]

Some older radio communications equipment used slide switches with three or more
poles to change how the internal circuitry behaves (tuning range, power outputs,
etc.). Physically, the pole contactor slides across each of the contact positions
while staying in contact with a bar or rail inside the switch. The track the pole
contactor moves in usually has small indentations, and a small ball bearing is
used to provide some tactile feedback in the form of a "click" or "bump" at
each of the contact positions.

Slides switches are available in miniature and micro forms, along with surface-mounted types. PCB mounted versions can be found in both vertical and right-angle designs, and momentary actions are pass:[<span class="keep-together">available.</span>]

==== Rotary

Slide and rotary switches are closely related,((("switches", "rotary")))((("rotary switches"))) in that a slide switch is similar
to a rotary switch laid out flat with the contacts all in a row instead of a
circle. The action of each type is essentially the same. As with slide switches,
a rotary switch can have multiple poles. In some older types of test equipment,
it wasn't uncommon to find rotary switches with upward of 10 or even 15 poles
per switch.

Rotary switches are readily available and, like every other switch type, come in
a variety of sizes and capabilities. <<one_pole_rotary>> shows a single-pole
rotary switch with six positions. One solder eyelet is the pole, and the rest are
the switch-position terminals.

[[one_pole_rotary]]
.Single-pole rotary switch
image::images/pect_0610.png[align="center"]

Rotary switches come in PCB-mount versions, both through-hole and SMT, and there
are even some types,((("printed circuit boards (PCBs)", "rotary switches mounted on"))) like the one shown in <<pcb_smt_rotary>>, that require a
small screwdriver to operate. These are typically used in places where there might
be an occasional need to alter the behavior of a circuit, but not under end-user
control. Testing is one situation that comes to mind, or perhaps infrequently
changing the behavior of a device.

[[pcb_smt_rotary]]
.Surface-mounted micro rotary switch
image::images/pect_0611.png[align="center"]

==== Pushbutton

The pushbutton switch is about as ubiquitous ((("switches", "pushbutton")))((("pushbutton switches")))as the toggle switch and can be
found on everything from a cell phone to the ignition button on late-model cars
with electronic key-lock systems. They come in a wide range of styles, some
internally illuminated, some not. <<panel_mount_pushbutton>> shows a panel-mounted((("printed circuit boards (PCBs)", "pushbutton switch mounted on")))((("panel-mounted pushbutton switch")))
pushbutton switch, and <<pcb_pushbutton>> shows a PCB version.

Like the other switches we've reviewed so far, a pushbutton switch can have
more than one pole, although SP and DP types are the most common. The common
type of mechanism is a momentary action, but there are some that will mechanically
stay in one position or another, like the emergency stop switches on elevators
and industrial machines.

[[pcb_pushbutton]]
.PCB-mounted pushbutton switch
image::images/pect_0613.png[align="center"]


==== Snap-Action

A snap-action switch is typically found in the role((("switches", "snap-action")))((("snap-action switches"))) of a sensor, rather than
something that a human might operate, although there are some varieties that
do incorporate a toggle or pushbutton mechanism. These switches are typically
used to sense things like physical limits for the moving parts of a machine,
the passing of a lobe of a cam, or if a device is resting on a surface or
suspended in the air. <<snap_action_switch>> shows a small snap-action switch.
Various other types of input mechanisms are available, including rollers,
plunge rollers, and pushbuttons.

[[snap_action_switch]]
.Snap-action switch with leaf actuator
image::images/pect_0614.png[align="center"]

A snap-action switch is usually intended for heavy use, and some are sealed
to prevent accidental fires or even explosions in hazardous environments
(such as might be found in grain elevators). As you might expect, a heavy-duty
snap-action switch tends to be both physically large and somewhat expensive,
although there are some miniature types available that are popular with the
robotics folks.

=== Slide and Rotary Switch Circuits

As mentioned earlier, slide and rotary switches are similar in terms of
functionality,((("circuits", "slide and rotary switch")))((("switches", "slide and rotary switch circuits")))((("slide switches", "circuits")))((("rotary switches", "circuits"))) and they differ mainly in their physical form. Electrically, the
objective of both types is to select a circuit from multiple choices.
<<a4_pos_slide_switch>> shows the schematic representation of a four-position
double-pole slide switch, similar to <<pcb_mount_slide_switch>>, but with one
additional position.

[[a4_pos_slide_switch]]
.Diagram of a four-position slide switch
image::images/pect_0615.png[align="center"]

The schematic for a five-position rotary switch like the one in <<one_pole_rotary>>
is shown in <<a5_pos_rotary_switch>>.

If a slide or rotary switch has multiple poles,((("poles", "slide and rotary switches having multiple poles, schematics"))) the old-style schematic convention is
to show the physical connection between each of the poles with a dashed line, although
in some schematics, each pole might be located in different parts of the drawing. More
current schematics dispense with the dashed line and just use a numbering scheme (e.g.,
SW1-A, SW1-B, etc.) to indicate the poles of a single switch assembly.

[[a5_pos_rotary_switch]]
.Diagram of a five-position rotary switch
image::images/pect_0616.png[align="center"]

=== Switch Selection Criteria

There are three primary criteria for selecting a switch: what the switch needs
to do (electrical characteristics), how it needs to do it (physical form), and
where it will be placed (mounting).((("switches", "selection criteria"))) As often happens in engineering, there are
trade-offs that must be made. That really awesome little miniature toggle
switch that would be perfect for a project might not be able to handle the
current flowing through the circuit it is controlling. Conversely, you might
find that the right switch for the voltage and current levels involved will
be physically bigger than the rest of the project components combined. The
goal is to find the middle ground and pick the best possible switch for the
job.

Here are some suggested essential criteria to consider when selecting a switch:

How much voltage will the switch need to pass:[<span class="keep-together">handle?</span>]::
 Consider the application and the range of voltages the switch could possibly encounter. Select one that is capable of at least the anticipated maximum value.

How much current will flow through the switch?::
 Consider how much current the switch will need to handle. Even at low voltage levels, such as 5V DC, there can be considerable current. While internal arcing at low voltage might not be a problem, with a large enough amount of current moving through the switch, its contacts won't last long. With a significant amount of current, the inherent resistance in the switch's contacts and metal bus components can be enough to cause the switch to overheat, or even burst into flames. If possible, selecting a switch with twice the capacity of the expected maximum current is a prudent choice. 

How many circuits, or contacts, will the switch need to have?::
 Don't use a switch with more poles than is really necessary. The more poles a switch has, the more expensive it will be, and the more prone it will be to failure. Less is better.

Should the switch be a toggle, a slider, a rotary type, or some other mechanism?::
 Don't let aesthetics be the primary guiding criteria to switch selection. A nifty-looking switch might seem like a good idea, but will it be easy for the user to operate? Will its function be intuitively obvious? Will it be able to endure multiple operations over an extended period of time? Could someone wearing gloves operate the switch? These are consideration that often get a lot of scrutiny in engineering design meetings, and for good reason. Many a gadget has been built with cool space-age controls, only to fail miserably in actual use after a short period of typical user abuse.

Does the switch need to be small? How small?::
 This criteria is related to the previous consideration, but here the main concern is size versus cost versus available mounting space. Miniature switches that are also rugged aren't cheap, and they can be a pain to assemble into a design. Select the largest switch you can reasonably use, given the physical constraints of its intended mounting location and the manner in which it is physically connected to the circuit.

Should the switch be a low-force type, or does it need to have a stiff mechanism?::
 This might seem like an odd topic, but it's one that is sometimes overlooked in commercial designs, resulting in a product that is difficult (or sometimes even painful!) to use. An extremely stiff slide switch, for example, can leave a user with a sore finger if it must be operated routinely. A rotary switch can be frustrating if it is difficult to turn to a desired position. On the other hand, there are situations where a stiff switch really is the correct choice. The switches on heavy machinery or high-voltage equipment, where an incorrect switch position could result in major problems, are two possible applications. The upshot here is to select a switch that is suitable for the intended application and won't be easily bumped or jostled into an incorrect position, if that's a concern.

What are the mounting options?((("mounting options", "for switches"))) Panel, PCB, or something else?::
 Toggle, pushbutton, and rotary switches can be mounted in holes drilled into a panel or in some type of chassis. A slide switch will require a rectangular hole, with the length of the rectangle being proportional to the number of switch stop positions. The downside of panel or chassis-mounted switches with soldered leads is that wires are needed to connect the switch to the circuit it is controlling. Switches are also available for PCB mounting, like any other component on the PCB. With a PCB-mounted switch, the wires are eliminated, but now the switch is part of something else, which will have its own mounting requirements. A panel or chassis-mounted switch with PCB terminals can also be used to hold the PCB it is part of.

How rugged should the mounting be?::
 A switch mounted using a shaft nut or mounting screws will typically be more robust then one soldered onto a PCB, although this depends to a large extent on how well the switch is soldered to the PCB. Some PCB mount switches come with extra metal tabs as part of their body construction. These are intended to be soldered into holes in the PCB to secure the switch. There are protective guards and covers available for toggle switches to help protect them from both impact damage and accidental pass:[<span class="keep-together">operation.</span>]

=== Switch Caveats

Being a mechanical device, a switch has certain limitations and behaviors that
you should be aware of.((("switches", "caveats")))((("toggle switches", "contact bounce")))((("rocker switches", "contact bounce")))((("pushbutton switches", "contact bounce")))((("snap-action switches", "contact bounce"))) With toggle, rocker, pushbutton, and snap-action switches,
_contact bounce_ can be a significant concern.((("contact bounce"))) If a switch is used to control power
to a circuit or a device, this might not be an issue, but when a switch is
used to generate or control a signal (such as, say, an input to a microcontroller
that is used to count something), contact bounce can become a very big deal.

Contact bounce can be reduced electronically with a filter or a one-shot timer (see
<<Chapter_11>> and <<Appendix_A>>) or, if the switch is connected to a microcontroller,
it can be eliminated in software. It is beyond the scope of this book to address
software topics, but check out the texts listed in <<Appendix_D>> for details.

Contact bounce is not the main issue with slide or rotary switches.((("slide switches", "caveats")))((("rotary switches", "caveats"))) In a slide or
rotary switch, you should be aware that some switches don't immediately switch from
one set of contacts to another.((("shorting switches")))((("nonshorting switches"))) In other words, they can be either _shorting_ or
_nonshorting_. A shorting switch will allow the pole contactor to span two
contacts when moving between them. A nonshorting type will have a definite
physical gap between the contacts. Why would you want to use a shorting type
slide or rotary switch? They are commonly found in circuits that carry audio
signals, since the shorting behavior reduces any "pop" that might occur when
switching between, say, microphone A and microphone B, or from one filter setting
to another. Never use a shorting switch in a circuit that is handling power, as
opposed to signals, or evil things might occur, and in general, don't use a shorting
type switch unless there is a definite need for it.

[[summary_ch06]]
=== Summary

In this chapter, we've looked at some of the various types of switches. You should now have a good idea of what types and styles of switches
are available and also have a basic understanding of how they work mechanically.
We have reviewed toggle switches, slide switches, rocker switches, pushbutton
types, and rotary switch mechanisms. We also took a brief look
at snap-action switches, which are common in industrial environments and some
robotics applications, but aren't usually seen in small electronic devices.

The main takeaway from this chapter is to select the switch that meets the needs
of the application, unless, of course, you are simply throwing something together
to see if it works. Spending some quality time online reviewing the various switches
that are available is a worthwhile effort, and a trip to a local electronics outlet
can also be pass:[<span class="keep-together">informative.</span>]
