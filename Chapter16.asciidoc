== Packaging

Packaging is a key aspect of electronics design, ((("packaging", id="ix_packaging", range="startofrange")))and some people make a lifelong
career of it. For a consumer product, creating the package might involve the skills of
an industrial designer or graphic artist, someone well versed in thermal analysis,
an RF engineer to check for radio-frequency emissions, and a production engineer to
make sure that the package can actually be built in a cost-effective manner. When
a package is being designed for applications such as aerospace or marine applications, a whole
new set of requirements comes into play. Physical volume, weight, electrical connections,
mounting constraints, and even the type of paint used are just some examples. It
can get quite involved.

However, for the most part, packaging for small- to medium-sized projects, particularly
those that are prototypes or one-off devices, just involves applying a lot of common
sense and asking some key questions. This chapter addresses those key questions and
also examines issues such as plastic versus metal, sources for
chassis components, and the potential of unconventional packages.

=== The Importance of Packaging

Every circuit or device that isn't ((("packaging", "importance of")))going to spend its life on a workbench needs an
enclosure of some sort to protect it. Even if it does end up living out its days in
the back corner of a workbench, a package will prevent things falling into it or
someone accidentally touching it while it's active.

Packaging can range from the simple to the complex. It all depends
on where the device will reside and the type of environmental conditions it can
be expected to encounter. If something will sit on a bench or a shelf, it
might not need much more than an enclosure to keep out dust, stray bits of metal,
and the occasional curious finger. If it's going to be outside, it will need
to withstand the extremes of the local climate. A device that is
intended to be wearable must contend with things like lint, dust, dirt,
and sweat.

=== Types of Packaging

The material used((("packaging", "types of"))) for packaging generally falls into two basic categories: plastic and
metal. Although wood is sometimes used for things like high-end designer PC enclosures,
it's not really a good material when it comes to long-term durability and electrical
shielding. The same goes for material like cardboard or foamcore. Not really a good idea.

==== Plastic

Plastic can be easily formed into just about any shape you might care to
imagine, and once the final shape((("plastic, using for packaging")))((("packaging", "types of", "plastic"))) is fixed and set in a mold, you can make as many of
the packages as you like, as quickly as the injection molding machine can push them out.
Plastic is also easy to work with using a drill press and a rotary tool, and the harder
types can even be machined with a lathe or vertical mill.

Early plastic enclosures used a material called _Bakelite_,((("Bakelite"))) invented in 1907 and named
after Leo Baekeland. If you've even seen (or used) a vintage rotary-dial telephone,
you've seen Bakelite. It was commonly used for everything from electrical insulators
to radio and phonograph enclosures, and even in jewelry and children's toys. Today,
Bakelite has largely been replaced by plastics such as ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene
styrene), polystyrene, or PVC. Although modern plastics are easier to mold and less
brittle, Bakelite is still used in applications where its unique properties
are required.

Plastic does have some drawbacks when compared to metal enclosures. For one thing, many
plastics don't tolerate UV very well, so it might not be a good idea to leave a plastic
enclosure in a location where it gets direct sunlight. Plastic does not provide any
shielding against unwanted electromagnetic radiation, so it needs to be coated on the
inside with special conductive paint. Strength might also be a consideration, as a plastic
part simply does not have the strength of a metal part of the same size and shape.

The mass production of a plastic part requires a mold, which is where most of the
up-front expense lies. ((("plastic, using for packaging", "creating a mold")))Creating a mold is a painstaking process, in both the design and
the fabrication. When designing a mold form, the engineer must take into account things
like unfillable gaps or corners, any volume change of the plastic as the temperature
changes, and the design of any removable secondary mold parts to create complex internal
shapes. Once the design is complete, a machinist creates the mold sections from metal.
Only after the mold has been cleaned, polished, and checked for accuracy does it go out
for production use. The mold design and fabrication process can cost many thousands of
dollars, so it's not something to be taken lightly. If there is an error, the whole
process might have to start over again.

Stock items such as plastic tubes, extrusions, and molded cases are also options for
packaging with plastic. The advantage here is that the final package might not need much
in the way of modifications to be immediately useful. Perhaps a few holes for indicators
and connectors, and perhaps some internal parts like PCB card guides and a battery
holder mounting arrangement (if a battery is used).

==== Metal

For creating electronics enclosures, metal can be cast into a mold, extruded into a tubular((("packaging", "types of", "metal")))((("metal, using for packaging")))
or rectangular shape, and formed into sheets, and a complex shape can be machined from a solid
block of metal. Metal is extremely versatile, strong, and sometimes even lighter
than an equivalent plastic enclosure, but it is not always very easy to work with.

Metal casting uses a mold created in damp sand into which hot molten metal is poured. As
with a plastic mold, it is essential to get the mold right at the outset. Metal casting
is typically used for heavy-duty enclosures intended for harsh environments. It doesn't
show up much in consumer electronics, although it can be used for small items produced
in large quantities. Some early portable MP3 players used cast metal cases, for example.

Extrusions are typically aluminum and come in a variety of shapes.
The most common enclosure for elecronics is a rectangular extrusion with PCB guides formed into the inside
of the extrusion. Extrusions can also be formed into a variety of shapes that can be used to
create parts that will mount onto or inside something else, such as PCB card guides,
brackets, or wiring channels.

Extrusions are available in various lengths with slots for holding panels and special
adapters for connecting to other extrusions at 45- and 90-degree angles. Using these parts,
you can build an enclosure using extrusions, some sheet metal, and the appropriate screws,
nuts, and bolts to hold it all together.

Sheet metal fabrication has been used to create everything from the chassis in radio
receivers to enclosures for computers. Almost all PC cases are made from sheet metal and
fabricated using various bending, punching, and stamping techniques. Working with sheet
metal requires a brake (for bending), a shear (for cutting), a drill press, a rivet tool,
and perhaps a spot welder. For making large (greater than 1 inch) holes, or holes with a noncircular
shape (such as 'D' connectors), a hydraulic punch is essential.

Odds are that not many people will have all those tools lying about in their home shop. For
this reason, custom sheet-metal fabrication, like mass-production plastic-injection molding, is
typically used only when a large number of items need to be fabricated, or the cost
and effort of building a one-off enclosure is outweighed by the need.

Machining from a solid block of metal can create a beautiful, lightweight chassis, but at
the expense of machine shop time and a lot of wasted material. It is commonly used for low-volume things like parts of satellites and space probes, where the dimensions are unique
to the particular application (space vehicles are largely hand-made things, and each is
different). A machined enclosure might also be used as part of a prototype that will later
be cast in metal or molded from plastic.

=== Stock Enclosures

Stock enclosures are available in a wide range((("packaging", "stock enclosures")))((("stock enclosures"))) of styles, size, and materials. Browsing
through the available products from the enclosure and chassis manufacturers listed in
<<Appendix_E>> will give you some idea of the vast range of products available, and that's
just a small sample.

==== Plastic Enclosures

Companies such as Hammond Manufacturing make a variety((("plastic enclosures")))((("stock enclosures", "plastic enclosures")))((("packaging", "stock enclosures", "plastic enclosures"))) of plastic enclosures for electronics,
ranging from simple boxes to complete chassis with a carry handle.

<<small_enclosure_1>> shows one example, an ABS plastic box with a lid attached
by two screws. It measures 1.38 inches long by 1.38 inches wide by .59 inches deep.

[[small_enclosure_1]]

<<small_enc_pic>> shows what the enclosure looks like in real life (a ruler is included to
provide a sense of scale).

[[small_enc_pic]]
.Photo of the small ABS plastic enclosure
image::images/pect_1602.png[align="center",width="350"]

What could possibly fit into such a tiny space? For starters, there is room inside for a PCB
and even a battery. A simple display or some LEDs might be brought out through the cover (just
drill or cut holes and let the display devices protrude through them). Attach a cloth or elastic
loop to the back, and it could be something wearable. Glue one part of a square Velcro pad to
the back and the device might be something you could put somewhere in a vehicle and take with
you when you park it. A micro-USB connector could be brought out through the side of the
enclosure. Here are some ideas for what could be made with a small enclosure like this:

- One part of a driveway light beam sensor (either the sensor or the IR LED sender).
- A really tiny CMOS camera.
- A fall sensor for an elderly person.
- Temperature and humidity display for use inside a vehicle.
- A koi pond water-level detector (to shut off the valve when the water level is high enough and turn it on when it is too low).
- Soil moisture detector (a red light might mean it's dry, and a green light could indicate sufficient soil moisture).
- An add-on to enhance an electronic toy (put an AVR microcontroller in the case and program it using the Arduino boot loader and software tools).
- A data logger to collect readings from a sensor and offload them later.

And the list goes on. But sometimes it's just not possible to cram everything into a small
box, so a larger box is necessary. <<small_enclosure_2>> shows an enclosure commonly called a _project box_.((("project box")))
This is an ABS box with a thin aluminum cover held in
place with four self-tapping screws (see <<Chapter_2>> for some caveats regarding self-tapping
screws). It measures 1.5 inches high by 3.25 inches wide and 5.25 inches long (all measurements approximate).

[[small_enclosure_2]]
.Polystyrene "project box" with metal cover
image::images/pect_1603.png[align="center",width="350"]

It's common to get a cheap project box and then find out that the sides have warped inward
so that the cover doesn't fit correctly. This is not uncommon with injection molded plastic
parts, but if the box has stiffener ribs molded into it, the warping will be much less
noticeable. Also, because of the warped plastic and loose production tolerances, the cover usually
doesn't fit correctly to begin with. To make a cheap project box cover fit correctly and look
presentable, you will probably need to trim the edges of the cover panel slightly on all sides.
I use a sander like the one shown in <<cover_sanding>> to do this. Ideally, if the cover fits
correctly, it shouldn't bend or warp in the corners when the four screws are tightened. You will
still probably need to pull out the sides of the box slightly when mounting the cover, because
they will undoubtedly be warped to some degree.

[[cover_sanding]]
.Reducing the overall size of a project box cover panel
image::images/pect_1604.png[align="center",width="450"]

Because of the hassles and aggravation, I don't recommend this type of enclosure. They tend
to be poorly made and don't hold up well to rough handling. But then again, they are cheap, and
sometimes it's about the only thing available on short notice. You can purchase them at many
retail electronics outlets and supply houses.

[NOTE]
====
The metal cover plates sold with plastic project boxes tend to be very thin. To get the best results
when drilling holes, I recommend a drill press with sacrificial backing material, as described in
<<Chapter_4>>. It is easy to warp the metal plate if too much pressure is applied during
drilling without any back support.

Of course, plastic enclosures come in shapes other than rectangles and squares. <<plastic_cases>>
shows some examples of the many different shapes that are available. Other shapes, not shown here,
include game controllers, control pendants, and cases with a precut opening for a touchscreen
display. It's easy to become lost for a couple of hours online looking at all of the types
that are available.

[[plastic_cases]]
.Plastic enclosures in various shapes

==== Cast Aluminum Enclosures

Stock enclosures are available in cast aluminum ((("cast aluminum closures")))((("stock enclosures", "cast aluminum")))((("packaging", "stock enclosures", "cast aluminum")))((("metal, using for packaging", "cast aluminum enclosures")))for applications where the enclosure needs to
be rugged and able to withstand harsh conditions. <<cast_enclosure>> shows a typical small cast aluminum enclosure.

Some cast enclosures are available with rubber gaskets to protect the contents from rain, snow,
and dirt. If, for example, you wanted to build a device to monitor something in a forest
(rainfall or soil moisture content, for example), a sealed cast enclosure would be a good
choice. Connectors can be mounted through holes in the enclosure and also sealed with rubber or
neoprene gaskets. Some types are available with fins on the exterior for heat dissipation.

==== Extruded Aluminum Enclosures

Extruded aluminum is popular as an enclosure, and vendors offer various styles and sizes.((("metal, using for packaging", "extruded aluminun enclosures")))((("extruded aluminum enclosures")))((("packaging", "stock enclosures", "extruded aluminum")))((("stock enclosures", "extruded aluminum"))) <<ext_enclosure>>
shows a generic example with circuit boards that slide inside and
end covers to close it all up.

[[ext_enclosure]]
.Rectangular extruded aluminum enclosure
image::images/pect_1607.png[align="center",width="350"]

If you are old enough to remember what a modem is and have((("modems"))) actually used one, odds are
you've seen a commercial product built into an extruded enclosure. These types of enclosures
were once popular and were used for everything from telecommunications devices to
miniature test equipment. They are excellent enclosures for homemade test instruments, audio
gear, and electronic music recording or sound processing gadgets, to name just a few
possible applications.

Variations on this theme use solid metal end panels rather than plastic, and
these are suitable for use in automobiles or other vehicles. The metal shell can be used
as a heatsink to dissipate heat from something like a voltage regulator or a power
transistor. <<ext_enclosure>> has metal end panels.

==== Sheet Metal Enclosures

Several enclosure manufacturers sell boxes and chassis made of formed sheet metal, either aluminum((("packaging", "stock enclosures", "sheet metal")))((("stock enclosures", "sheet metal")))((("metal, using for packaging", "sheet metal enclosures")))((("sheet metal enclosures")))
or steel, like the ones shown in <<sheetmetal_enc>>. One common type is the two-piece box, which
is fabricated along the lines of the diagram shown on the left side of <<sheetmetal_enc>>. A
two-piece box is made from two sheet-metal parts that have been bent or stamped to fit across each
other, so that one piece forms the front, back, and bottom of the enclosure, while the other
serves as the top and sides. In terms of ruggedness and quality, these can range from cheap
sheet-metal stampings held together with self-tapping sheet-metal screws to products with press-in
nuts in the cover mounting flanges, baked-on finishes, and ventilation slots cut into the top
cover. As with just about everything else, it depends on how much you are willing to pay for it.

[[sheetmetal_enc]]
.Common sheet-metal electronics chassis styles
image::images/pect_1608_mod.png[align="center"]

[TIP]
====
Be sure to pay attention to the type of metal used in a sheet-metal enclosure. Steel is more
durable, but it can be harder to work with than aluminum. A steel enclosure will also be heavier
than an equivalent size in aluminum. Aluminum enclosures tend to be made from soft metal, and it
can take some patience to get good results when  you're cutting or drilling it. The upside is that you
can use something like a rotary tool (discussed in <<Chapter_4>>) to make rectangular holes in
an aluminum chassis or enclosure, or even a nibbler tool (also discussed in <<Chapter_4>>), but
unless a steel enclosure is made with very thin gauge metal it can be a real chore to create
noncircular holes in it.
====

<<sheetmetal_box>> shows a real-life example of a sheet-metal enclosure. It is made from
steel and it's already painted, so all that's needed are the electronics to go inside and some
rubber feet for it to sit on.

[[sheetmetal_box]]
.A two-part sheet-metal enclosure
image::images/pect_1609.png[align="center",width="350"]

The second common type of sheet-metal enclosure is shown on the right in
<<sheetmetal_enc>>. This is essentially a box with an open side. Mounting flanges are formed
along the open edges of the box, and a cover plate mounts over the open side with either
self-tapping sheet-metal screws or machine screws (if press-in nuts have been used). It is
commonly referred to as a _chassis_, rather than an enclosure, because generally people mount
parts inside, perhaps with a transformer or other large items bolted to the top, and then
mount the entire thing in some other, larger, assembly.

One way to use a flat chassis box like this is to bolt it to the back of a 19-inch rack panel
at a 90-degree angle, as shown in <<rack_chassis>>, and mount whatever controls, displays,
and indicators are needed on the rack panel.

[[rack_chassis]]
.Rack mounted panel with sheet-metal chassis
image::images/pect_1610.png[align="center"]

If you need something a bit larger and more rugged than a sheet-metal enclosure or chassis,
a variety of enclosure kits are available. These kits allow you to build devices that look like
commercial products, and these types of enclosures are often used in the production of commercial
electronics devices.

Kits are more expensive than a simple enclosure, but low-cost products (such as the one shown in((("kits", "for enclosures")))
<<enc_kit>>) are available that require you to do the assembly work.

[[enc_kit]]
.An enclosure kit for a bench or desktop electronic device
image::images/pect_1611.png[align="center",width="350"]

If you need a larger enclosure, you might want to consider some of the larger, heavy-duty
enclosure kits that can be mounted into a 19-inch equipment rack. These types of kits aren't cheap
(around $200 to $300 is typical). If you've ever looked at professional audio equipment in a
music store, you've probably seen this type of chassis. Heavy-duty chassis like these are
also found in television and radio broadcast studios, and the rack-mounted servers used in data
centers are similar in design.

Technically, most of these would fall under the category of sheet-metal enclosures because they are
formed from cut and stamped pieces of metal, usually steel. The main difference between the examples shown in Figures pass:[<a href="sheetmetal_box">16-9</a>] and pass:[<a href="enc_kit">16-11</a>] is that one is very simple with a minimal number of parts,
while the other has threaded holes for the screws, internal mounting points, braces, and other
features.

=== Building or Recycling Enclosures

While there are many options to choose from when it comes to buying a ready-made enclosure, sometimes((("packaging", "building or recycling enclosures")))
it's worthwhile (and fun) to build your own from raw materials or recycled items. Wandering through
a secondhand store, browsing the electrical section in a hardware store, or even going through
old toys that the kids have outgrown can help spark ideas and yield some interesting finds that you
can use in your own project.

==== Building Plastic and Wood Enclosures

If you are comfortable with cutting sheet plastic, you can build your own enclosures.((("packaging", "building or recycling enclosures", "building plastic and wood enclosures")))((("plastic enclosures", "building"))) Ideally,
you would want to have a drill press and a miniature table saw (such as the tools shown in <<Chapter_3>>).
A rotary tool and a sander like the one shown in <<cover_sanding>> are also very useful. <<plastic_sheet_box>>
shows an exploded view of such an enclosure.

[[plastic_sheet_box]]
.Enclosure made from plastic sheet stock
image::images/pect_1612.png[width="300",align="center"]

The box consists of six panels. Assuming that it is made from 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch sheet stock, you can assemble it using MEK to form plastic welds at the joints, or epoxy if the plastic isn't compatible with
MEK (see <<Chapter_2>> for information on adhesives). If you want to give the assembly a removable lid,
you can use 1/4-inch by 1/4-inch pieces of extruded square cross-section posts cut from bar stock and attached
to the inside corners, as shown in <<corner_posts_assy>>. This makes the whole assembly much more rigid,
and if you drill and tap the posts to accept a #4 screw, they can be used to secure the lid on the
enclosure.

.Fabrication details for corner posts in a plastic enclosure
image::images/pect_1614_mod.png[]

Plastic can be worked with the same tools employed for metal. The primary differences involve the
softness of the material and the tendency of plastic to melt and gum things up, so parameters like the tool
speed on a mill or drill will need to be adjusted to compenstate. The lubricants used with aluminum or
steel might not work well with plastic, particularly the solvent-based types. There are water-based
lubricants available.

Cubes and rectangular boxes aren't the only options. You can make an enclosure with a sloped front
panel or one that has a 90-degree bend to fit around the corner of something. The possibilities are
limited only by your imagination and the materials you are using. Just bear in
mind that, unless you really want to go to the trouble of making beveled edges, using a milling
machine to make slots for things to slide into, and know how to sand and paint plastic, enclosures
built with this technique have a tendency to look like hand-made items (fine-grit sandpaper and
epoxy spray paint can help a lot with the aesthetics, however). Perhaps that's OK, depending on the
application, but if you really need a polished look in a hurry, you might want to consider buying a
ready-made enclosure. Consider your options before jumping into something like this, and if the
trade-offs are worth the effort, you can end up with something that looks nice and will last
a long time.

If you have woodworking skills, or know someone who does, and you have access to tools like ((("wood enclosures, building")))a planer,
jointer, and router table, then you can make enclosures from wood. Another option that is quite
popular with the maker movement is to use a CNC (computer numeric control) router or a laser to cut
pieces from wood panels. The wood can be thin plywood (birch is a common choice), or MDO (Medium Density
Overlay) panels. A CNC router can produce clean cuts, but it's noisy and somewhat messy (lots of sawdust
to deal with), and the cutting tool needs to be really sharp to avoid tearing the wood. A laser produces
clean cuts with no rips or burrs, but it does tend to burn the edges of the wood pieces, leaving a dark
outline around each part. But even with just conventional tools, you can still create good-looking things,
like the device shown in <<solar_device>>. This is a solar intensity measurement device I helped my
daughter make for a science fair project. It might have the look of something high-tech, but it's really
just some pine boards, a piece of plywood, and some paint.

[[solar_device]]

==== Unconventional Enclosures

Just about anything that is the right size, easily sealed (more or less), and sturdy enough to take((("packaging", "building or recycling enclosures", "unconventional enclosures")))((("PC tubing, using as an enclosure")))
whatever physical abuse might get thrown at it has the potential to be an enclosure for electronics.
An enclosure might be something that you might not think of as an enclosure for electronics, such as PVC
or ABS pipe. You can get diameters ranging from 1/2 inch up to 8 inches at most hardware and home improvement
stores, and a large number of attachments and adapters are available.

<<pvc_tube>> shows one way to use a section of PVC tubing as a sealed enclosure. This is an ideal
low-cost housing for electronics used in an environment like a greenhouse, as an automated weather
monitor, or as a remote sensor strapped to the side of a tree (for instance). It could also contain
a level sensor (or two) and be mounted in a vehicle to determine when leveling jacks are extended
to the correct height.

[[pvc_tube]]
.A section of PVC tubing used as an enclosure
image::images/pect_1616.png[width="250",align="center"]

<<pvc_tube>> shows a DB-9 connector, for a couple of reasons. First, DB-type
connectors are available with glass-filled bodies and solid pins, which makes them suitable for
applications like vacuum chambers and harsh environments. For many applications, a plastic-filled
body would probably be acceptable, but the pins do need to be a solid machined type to block moisture
entry into the tube. Secondly, the rectangular shape of the DB connector allows it to align vertically
on the tube with a minimum amount of radius offset under the connector flange, which in turn reduces
the amount of silicon rubber or epoxy resin needed to seal it to the tube. Remember that the connector
can be wired to carry whatever signal and power lines are necessary, including USB, and a DB-25 could
be used if more connections are needed. Once the mating connector is attached and the mounting screws
are secure, the entire connector assembly can be encased in a generous application of clear silicon
rubber. If it ever needs to be removed, it can be cut away with a sharp pocket knife.

Sometimes a useful little enclosure is an empty container that would otherwise be tossed in the trash
or the recycle bin, like the little tins that mints come in. It turns out that the Altoids brand tins
are popular for project enclosures. Searching "altoids tin projects" on Google returns around
127,000 results. Switch to images and take a look at what people have done with these ubiquitous little
metal boxes. You'll find everything from ham radio modules to effects for guitar players, from MP3 players to set-top video players. You can even buy box lots of empty tins on eBay.

Steel food, coffee, and tobacco cans are another possibility,((("steel cans, using as enclosures")))((("metal, using for packaging", "steel cans"))) although you will most likely need to
fabricate an end cover to replace the one that was removed when the can was opened. Metal cans can be
pressed into service as antennas for wireless data links, as a housing for one end of a light-beam
communication link, and as a chassis for mounting various sensors. The blind rivets described in
<<Chapter_2>> can be used to quickly and easily attach a mounting bracket.

The main thing to keep in mind when using a coffee or tobacco can in a situation where it can be exposed
to rain or ambient moisture is that you will need to strip the old paint, prime the bare metal, and then
repaint it both inside and out to prevent rust. That can be a lot of work if you don't happen to have a
sand-blaster handy or a bench grinder with a wire brush wheel, so you might want to consider that.

Small utility boxes like the ones used for residential AC wiring can also be useful for some applications,((("utility boxes, using as enclosures")))
and browsing the selection on the shelves at a hardware store or electrical supply outlet can be a good
source of inspiration. Granted, most of the enclosures designed for use with electrical power wiring
aren't all that visually appealing, because they're designed to be bolted to a flat surface or hidden
behind a wall. But it's still possible to find something that will do the job, and it doesn't take too
much effort to cut the mounting tabs off a molded box if you really don't need them.

==== Repurposing Existing Enclosures

Occasionally, you might come across an intriguing enclosure with something already inside of it.((("packaging", "building or recycling enclosures", "repurposing existing enclosures")))
Well, if you don't need whatever was originally packaged inside, you can pull it out and put in
your own circuitry. Candidates for repurposing include old test equipment, junk PC components
(particularly old outboard disk drive enclosures), and broken or discarded electronic toys like a
spy voice recorder or a sing-along headset microphone. Lots of possibilities there. If you like
harmless pranks, an old toy with something like an Arduino, or a wireless module like one of the
Bluetooth LE types described in <<Chapter_14>>, stuffed inside can be a source of significant
amusement.

While expending the time and effort to disassemble something and rebuild it to serve a new purpose
might be considered to be _extreme hacking_,((("extreme hacking"))) it is sometimes worth the effort if you really need a
particular type of packaging for your own invention and simply cannot find it anywhere else. If you
are careful, take your time, and don't mind expending the time on it, you can have a rugged,
professional, and unique enclosure.

=== Designing Packaging for Electronics

One of the best ways to get ideas for packaging is to look and see what others have done to((("packaging", "designing for electronics")))
solve their packaging problems. For example, <<walk-o-meter>> shows a personal pedometer built
into a small plastic case. It has a flip-up cover, an LCD display and a reset button, a molded
clip on the back for attaching it to your belt, and a removable fabric loop with a metal clip
(not shown) for securing it to your clothing if you don't happen to have a belt.

[[walk-o-meter]]
.A wearable personal pedometer
image::images/pect_1617.png[align="center",width="400"]

This is obviously a custom injection-molded item, and it appears to have been made with at least((("packaging", "designing for electronics", "wearable personal pedometer")))
three different parts: case backshell, front cover, and panel insert. It wasn't disassembled
because the device appears to have been glued together, and prying it apart could destroy it
(not to mention irritate its owner). It uses some type of small battery (like the ones shown
in <<Chapter_5>>), but the battery cannot be replaced. So when this thing dies, it's dead forever.
That might be a good time to take it apart and see what's inside, if you're willing to wait that
long.

The enclosure shown in <<small_enclosure_1>> could easily be used for a device like this.
Plastic and metal belt clips can be purchased from multiple sources, and the ones seen in a quick
Google search ranged from $3 to $6.

<<fluke_package>> shows another interesting example of an innovative packaging solution.
This is an old Fluke 1900A event ((("packaging", "designing for electronics", "Fluke two-part plastic instrument enclosure")))((("Fluke two-part plastic instrument enclosure")))counter and frequency meter.

The Fluke Corporation made a
series of electronic test equipment devices in the 1970s and 1980s featuring this two-part
packaging scheme. It's a brilliant design in that it has only two main parts, the front panel
with the attached PCB, and the shell. One screw in the rear holds it all together. The devices
also included a carry handle that can be set to act as a stand or folded back out of the way,
and only the front panel and internal PCB changes for each type of instrument.

Bud Industries manufactures a series of plastic enclosures that are similar to the Fluke design,((("Bud industries, plastic electronics enclosure")))((("packaging", "designing for electronics", "portable electronics enclosure")))((("portable electronics enclosure")))
including the IP-6130 and IP-6131 kits. <<bud_enclosure>> shows an example (with nothing in it,
of course). These are a bit more complicated than the Fluke package, because an enclosure kit must
be capable of being adapted to a variety of applications. You can pick up an IP-6130 from an
electronics distributor for around $26.

==== Device Size and Weight

If you're building something for your own personal use, considerations like size and weight((("packaging", "designing for electronics", "device size and weight")))
might not be at the top of the list. However, if you think you might want to mass—produce your
design, then these become major considerations.

Is the device wearable?

 * Wearable devices need to be small and lightweight.((("wearable devices"))) Anything over about 1.5 &#x00D7; 1.5 inches (or
around 38 &#x00D7; 38 millimeters) will probably be too big for a wrist, but things worn on a belt can be larger.
 * Depending on the application, a wearable device should be light enough to be largely unnoticed.
Something that has enough mass to bounce and tug with the wearer's every movement wouldn't be a
good idea for an athletic wearable, but it might be acceptable for something used as a shop or
construction worksite tool. Even then, something hanging from a belt that bounces around can be
annoying.((("portable electronics enclosure")))

Does the device need to be easily portable?

* If the device is something that a user might want to pick up and carry from one place to another,
it should be light enough that it doesn't throw his back out when he lifts it.
* A portable device might need a handle (or two) if it's too large to conveniently pick up and
carry one-handed. If handles are used, they must be sized to accommodate the weight of the device
and comfortably fit a generic hand size.

Will the device reside in a static environment, like a workbench or a 19-inch rack?

* When you are building something for a workbench, the size should be just large enough to hold all the
internal parts but not so large as to crowd out other things on the workbench.
* If the device will be mounted in a 19-inch rack, then the width is already constrained. The two
other dimensions to consider are height and depth. Sometimes a small equipment rack won't accommodate
anything with a depth of more than about 15 inches or so. Other racks, like those used for servers and
networking equipment, can handle things up to 28 inches or more deep.

Will the device be integrated into a vehicle of some type?

* If your device is intended to be mounted in an automobile or a truck, then the weight isn't as
big of a consideration as the size. It will need to be small enough to mount out of the way,
perhaps under a seat, under the dash, or in the trunk.
* If your device will be used in something like a boat, it will need to be environmentally
protected (see <<environmental_considerations>> for more on this). As with a device for a car or truck, the
weight isn't as much a factor as the size.

[[environmental_considerations]]
==== Environmental Considerations

Anything that will be exposed to the elements needs to be protected, and even things that are intended((("packaging", "designing for electronics", "environmental considerations")))((("environment, considering for enclosures")))
to be worn by a user should be protected if they might be exposed to sweat (sweat is very corrosive
to electronics).

Will the device be exposed to rain, sea spray, or other forms of moisture?

* A plastic package with a gasket to seal the enclosure is acceptable for small items. The plastic
should be thick enough to allow the cover to be tightly sealed without stripping screws or causing
the enclosure to warp.((("metal, using for packaging")))
* A cast-metal enclosure is a better choice than plastic if your device will be mounted in an exposed
location on a vehicle. Many cast-metal boxes are available with a gasket to seal the cover of the
enclosure, like the one shown in <<cast_enclosure>>. Applying a thin layer of silicone grease to the
gasket will help to prevent it from drying and rotting, and improves the water resistance of the seal.
* If the device will be mounted in an outside location, such as the control circuits for a remote
weather station or some kind of data acquisition device, then a sealed cast-metal enclosure might be
an appropriate choice. A section of((("PVC tubing, using for enclosure"))) PVC tubing (the so-called _Schedule 80_ outdoor-rated type) can
also be used. Assuming that a threaded end cap is used, the end cap will need to be sealed with Teflon
thread tape or silicone grease to keep dirt and moisture out.

Will the device be exposed to direct sunlight?

* Direct exposure to sunlight can destroy ((("plastic, using for packaging", "environmental considerations")))a plastic enclosure over time. The UV from sunlight can break
down the polymer chains in plastic, making it brittle and crumbly. Some plastics, like the PVC tubing
known as _Schedule 80_ can withstand direct sunlight for an extended period of time (on the order of
years), but even it will eventually have problems.
* Try to shade an electronic enclosure from direct sunlight, if at all possible. Something like the white
boxes used for official weather stations is one possibility. If nothing else, just putting your device
inside a larger box, like an electrical utility box, can shade it from the direct glare of the sun.

Will the device be used in a ((("dusty or dirty environment, packaging for")))dirty or dusty environment?

* For a dirty or dusty environment, the same general concepts for water resistance also apply. While
dust isn't normally conductive, it does create thermal issues and it can get into controls like
potentiometers and switches.
* If your device has a fan, odds are it won't be used in a moisture-prone environment, but it
might be used in a dusty situation. Any fans or ventilation holes will need to be filtered to keep
dust and dirt out, but still allow for air flow. Of course, this also means that someone will need
to clean or change the filters occasionally.

==== Thermal Considerations

Heat is one of the primary enemies of ((("thermal considerations for packaging")))electronics. Heat degrades components, including PCBs, and it
can lead to failures.

Will the device have a sealed enclosure?

* If a device is contained in a sealed enclosure, there is no way to air to circulate and remove
excess heat, which means that the component parts will need to be rated to operate at the nominal
internal temperate inside the enclosure.
* If at all possible, try to incorporate a heatsink for parts that generate heat. This includes things
like voltage regulators, power transistors, and motor control ICs. A heatsink might be the wall of a
cast-metal enclosure, or an add-on attachment for a TO-220 package (see <<Chapter_9>>).

Will the device be mounted near, or exposed to, a heat source?

* Try to avoid mounting your device in a location where it will be exposed to heat sources. For example,
the space under the hood of a car or in the engine well of a boat can get very hot. The sun is also
a major heat source, so things exposed to direct sunlight not only have to deal with direct UV, but
also the IR (infrared, or heat) part of the solar spectrum. So try to mount things like a solar-panel
motion controller gadget in a shady area, if possible, and run a cable out to the sensor that has to
sit in the sunlight.

=== Sources

<<enc_srcs>> lists the various sources for the commercially available enclosures discussed in this
chapter.((("packaging", "sources for commercial enclosures")))((("stock enclosures", "sources for"))) Although I've listed the manufacturer's name and URL, you can also find many of these at major
distributors and from Amazon. I've not listed the prices I paid, because they can vary, depending
on where you purchase a particular item. Shop around and compare to get the best price.

The enclosures listed in <<enc_srcs>> are just examples of what is available; there are many styles,
sizes, and types to choose from. Look around, compare prices, and if possible, go to local electronics
parts suppliers and ask to look at their stock of enclosures. Some will be helpful and let you see samples
of what they carry, and some might even have small enclosures sitting out on a display shelf.
Others will want you to have a part number already in hand and won't let you look in the stockroom.

=== Summary

This chapter has covered a wide range of electronics packaging types and techniques, from plastic
to metal. One thing that I hope came through is that packaging is an exercise in trade-offs.

Here are the ((("packaging", "key trade-off considerations")))key trade-off considerations we've covered:

* Plastic is often cheaper than metal, but it doesn't have the structural strength of metal, and it isn't
always suitable for large enclosures.
* Metal is stronger than plastic, and a metal enclosure can also serve as a heatsink, but it's more
difficult to work with than plastic and can be more expensive.
* Designing packaging for harsh environments can be a challenge and usually ends up as a trade-off between
environmental resistance and thermal considerations. 
+
A completely sealed plastic enclosure can't readily
dissipate heat, whereas a sealed metal enclosure can, but it will often be heavier and bulkier than the plastic
equivalent.

The chapter also showed that off-the-shelf enclosures are a good choice for prototypes, and sometimes they can also
be used for mass production. With mass production, there are up-front costs to be considered,
mainly for mold machining and production tooling. Lastly, we took a brief look at salvaging an enclosure
from an existing piece of equipment. Old test and computer equipment is a good place to look for enclosures,
ranging from small to very large, and even low-cost consumer electronics can sometimes be repurposed. The
major consideration here is the time and effort that will be expended versus the cost of buying something
that's already close enough to get the job done.((("packaging", range="endofrange", startref ="ix_packaging")))
