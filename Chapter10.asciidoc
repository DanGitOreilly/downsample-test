== Relays

Relays may be an old technology,((("relays", id="ix_relays", range="startofrange"))) but they are still essential in electronics. A relay
is basically just an electrically operated switch. Some are tiny and handle only small
amounts of current at low voltages, ((("contactors")))whereas other types, called _contactors_, are huge
(the size of a small refrigerator) and can safely deal with hundreds of amperes and
thousands of volts. But regardless of size and power capacity, all relays and their
close cousins the contactors use the same basic principle of operation.

This chapter describes various types ranging from low-current TTL-compatible reed relays
to high-power types used to control AC. Techniques for
controlling a relay from a low-voltage circuit are also covered, as well as some examples of how relays can be
used in control and logic circuits.

=== Relay Background

Relays have been around since about 1830.((("relays", "background"))) In fact, they are probably one of the oldest
types of electrical components (other than perhaps switches). Relay-based switching
systems replaced human telephone switchboard operators in mid–20th century, and some
early computers were built using relays, such as the Zuse Z3 (1941), the Atanasoff-Berry
Computer (1942), and the IBM ASCC/Harvard Mark I (1944). Although they haven't
changed much in terms of operation, they have evolved into a myriad of types over the
past 180 years.

Regardless of the actual internal physical arrangement, all electromechanical relays
operate on the principle of electromagnetism as the force driving a mechanism of some
sort. The mechanism might be an armature, metal reeds, or a contactor bus bar type of
arrangement.

==== Armature Relays

An armature relay has an internal((("armature relays")))((("relays", "armature relays"))) mechanism that transfers the motion induced by a
solenoid coil (an electromagnet) into physical motion, usually by means of some sort
of lever action. The motion of the armature can be used to control multiple sets of
contacts, and in some designs, a small pushbutton is brought out through the shell of
the relay to allow manual operation. <<relay_diagram>> is a simplified illustration
of a basic ((("SPST (single-pole single-throw) relays")))SPST type of relay.

[[relay_diagram]]
[role="wide"]
.A basic electromagnetic relay
image::images/pect_1001.png[align="center"]

Armature type relays can have one or more sets of ((("SPDT (single-pole double-throw) relays")))((("DPST (double-pole single-throw) relays")))((("DPDT (double-pole double-throw) relays")))contacts (SPST, SPDT, DPST, DPDT,
3PDT, and so on), with the multiple contacts all mechanically connected to the same
armature lever. Since they are basically electromechanical switches, the same general
contact descriptions apply. But relays have the advantage of an electromagnet, which
can exert considerable force. Relays with 10 or even 20 sets of contacts are sometimes
found in applications such as elevator controls and old-style telephone switching
systems. If you look ahead to <<octal_socket>>, you can see three sets of SPDT contacts
through the clear plastic shell of the relay.

==== Reed Relays

Some types of relays use a set of thin ((("reed relays")))metal strips called _reeds_ for((("reeds"))) the contacts. These
are sealed into a small glass tube, and a coil wound around the tube provides the
electromagnetic force that causes the reeds to bend and make contact. <<reed_relay>>
shows how this type of device works.

[[reed_relay]]
[role="float-bottom wide"]
.Reed relay operation
image::images/pect_1002.png[align="center"]

Any suitable magnetic field will cause the reeds to flex and make contact. In fact, the
sensors used in security systems to detect an open door or window are often nothing more
than the reed in its glass tube without a coil. A permanent magnet in the window or door
frame closes the contacts when it's close to the sensor. <<bare_reed_relay>> shows
a bare reed sensor module suitable for use with something like an Arduino or BeagleBone
single-board computer.

==== Contactor

In a high-current, high-voltage type of relay known as a ((("contactors")))((("relays", "contactors")))contactor, a solenoid coil is
used to pull in a bar or frame that holds the contacts, as shown in <<contactor_operation>>.
The result is rather like a piston, with the bus bar making a shorting connection between
the input and output terminals of the device.

Large contactors can be startling when they are energized, producing a loud bang as the
bus bar is pulled in by the solenoid.

[[bare_reed_relay]]
.Reed contacts without a coil
image::images/pect_1003.png[align="center"]

=== Relay Packages

Some relays are minuscule, while others are huge.((("relays", "packages"))) Relays come in printed circuit board form
factors with both through-hole and surface-mount packages. They can be found in packages that
use a socket, making them easily replaceable. Other types have lug terminals for use in
industrial and automotive applications, and still others have large bus-bar connections for
applications such as high-power motor controllers. It all depends on how much current they
are designed to handle at a given voltage and how much voltage and current is necessary to
drive the relay mechanism.

[[contactor_operation]]
[role="float-top wide"]

image::images/pect_1004.png[align="center"]


==== PCB Relays

Small relays for PCB applications ((("printed circuit boards (PCBs)", "relays")))((("relays", "PCB (printed circuit board)")))are available in types that range from reed
relays to compact armature devices that are capable of handling up to 120 VAC
at 10A or so. The previous section showed what a reed relay looks like (in <<bare_reed_relay>>). 
<<PCB_relay>> shows a compact relay designed to be mounted to a PCB.

The contact ratings for a relay of this type can be substantial, even through
the relay coil itself requires only 70–85 mA at 5V DC to operate. The actual
coil current depends on the resistance of the coil, and this can vary between
models and manufacturers. Note, however, that even 70 mA is way beyond the
output capability of most ICs, so some type of relay driver IC or a transistor
is needed to operate the relay, as described in <<relay_drivers>>. You can find
relays of this type controlling things like lighting, heater elements, small
electric motors, and as _drivers_ for((("driver relays"))) larger heavy-duty relays and contactors.

Reed relays are also available in packages that look like a typical 14-pin IC,
as well as packages that have bare wire leads for the contacts and the coil. A
reed relay might have a coil with a high enough resistance to allow it to be
driven directly from a microcontroller or logic IC, but a reed relay usually
won't carry as much current through its contacts (the reeds) as an armature
type of relay.

[[PCB_relay]]
.A PCB-mounted low-voltage relay
image::images/pect_1005_mod.png[width="350",align="center"]

Both miniature armature and reed relays are available in through-hole and
surface-mount packages.((("surface mounted components", "relays"))) The surface-mount relay shown in <<smt_relay>> is an
example (all dimensions are in millimeters).

[[smt_relay]]
.Surface-mount, low-voltage relay
image::images/pect_1006_mod.png[width="350",align="center"]

This happens to be the package drawing for a Panasonic TQ series relay, but similar
parts are available from Omron, NEC, and other manufacturers. The TQ2SA-5V has a
5V DC coil at 178 ohms with a nominal power consumption of 140 mW, and nominal
contact ratings of 0.5 A at 125V AC.

==== Lug-Terminal Relays

Relays with terminals specifically designed to accept ((("lug-terminal relays")))((("relays", "lug-terminal relays")))lug connectors, such as
those used in automotive and industrial applications, are available in both
vertical and horizontal mounting styles. Coil voltage ratings are available in both DC and AC values covering the range from 5V DC to 110V AC, or more. <<lug_terminal_relay>>
shows an example of an automotive lug-terminal relay with right-angle mounting
brackets. The coil operates at 12V DC, and the SPDT contacts are rated for 12V DC
at 40 A.

[[lug_terminal_relay]]
.Right-angle-mounted lug-terminal armature relay
image::images/pect_1007.png[align="center"]

This type of relay uses the crimped lug connectors discussed in <<Chapter_7>>
and the crimping tool shown in <<Chapter_3>>. Although it is possible to solder
to the terminals, this is generally not a good idea. Long ago, when the base
of the relay assembly was made of Bakelite, it wasn't as big of a problem, because
Bakelite can tolerate the heat of soldering. Modern relays are made using
plastics with much lower melting temperatures, and it is possible to deform
the base and cause the terminal to shift during soldering.

==== Socketed Relays

Many early relays used solder terminals for connections, so replacing one was
an exercise in desoldering and resoldering the wiring.((("relays", "socketed")))((("socketed relays"))) As this was a tedious
and error-prone process, clever engineers devised a means of using sockets
for relays, along the same lines as the sockets used for vacuum tubes. Some
socketed relays use round sockets with eight contact positions,((("octal sockets, relays"))) like the one
shown in <<octal_socket>>, while others use a rectangular socket with the holes
arranged in a grid pattern. Both types typically bring out the relay connections
to screw terminals, and either spade or ring lugs are used to connect the wiring.

[[octal_socket]]
.A typical octal (eight-pin) relay socket with screw terminals
image::images/pect_1008.png[width="400",align="center"]

These types of relays are mostly used in industrial applications that involve
switching high voltages and large amounts of current. They are also available
in an 11-pin form.

[NOTE]
====
Although octal sockets might seem like a throwback to the days of vacuum tubes,
they are still quite common and readily available. It is also possible to purchase
just the octal plug and put your own electronics into it. This is useful for
applications where you might want a sealed module (like, say, a sensor data
collector for a remote environmental monitor) that can quickly and easily be
replaced if necessary.
====

=== Selecting a Relay

Relays have two sets of primary((("relays", "selecting"))) specifications: coil and contacts. The coil will have a
nominal operating voltage and resistance, although sometimes the manufacturer will give
a power value instead of a resistance. If the current isn't specified, a quick application
of Ohm's law will tell us how much current we can expect the relay coil to draw, and we
can use the power specification to figure out the coil resistance (see <<Chapter_1>>).

The contacts should be rated to handle the load they will be controlling and then some.
To be safe, it's a good idea to derate the contacts by 50%, meaning that if you want to
control a 240V, 40 A contactor with a 24V AC coil that draws 36 mA with a _driver_ relay,((("driver relays")))
the smaller relay will need to have contacts that can handle 72 mA at 48V AC (twice
the current and voltage actually required). A smaller relay is used in this case because
the contactor uses AC for its coil, not DC. This makes it more challenging to control
with just a solid-state driver circuit, although it is possible (and not uncommon). Using
a small intermedite relay to handle the AC for the contactor's coil keeps things simple.

A small relay rated for 100 mA contact current should do fine for this application. ((("microcontrollers", "relay module for use with")))It
also implies that, for a situation like this, you could use a miniature PCB-mount relay,
like the units shown in <<relay_module>> (this is a bank of four, with built-in drivers).

[[relay_module]]
.Relay module for use with a microcontroller
image::images/pect_1009.png[width="300",align="center"]

However, a small relay might require anywhere from 20 to 50 mA for its coil, which means
it can't be controlled directly from a standard logic IC or microcontroller. In this case,
either a driver IC or a transistor driver (as described in <<relay_drivers>>)
will be needed. The board shown in <<relay_module>> doesn't have this problem, because the
drivers are already on the PCB.

A cascade of relays is not an uncommon situation. <<relay_chain>> shows how a sequence of((("relays", "chain of")))((("chain of relays")))
relay driver, small relay, and contactor can be connected to control a high-current,
high-power system. Conceptually, this can be extended as far as necessary, so that, in theory,
a 5V logic signal could control hundreds of amperes of current.

[[relay_chain]]

=== Relay Reliability Issues

Modern relays are fairly reliable, with claims for some small low-current
types of over 10,000,000 mechanical ((("relays", "reliability issues")))cycles with no load. But relays are
mechanical devices, and that implies wear and tear on the operating parts.

In a relay, a failure occurs when either the contacts can no longer pass
current effectively or the relay's coil will no longer operate the
contact mechanism. Two major sources of relay failure are _contact arcing_
and _coil overheating_.

==== Contact Arcing

Of course, the more load (power) a relay carries,((("arcing", "contact arcing in relays")))((("relays", "reliability issues", "contact arcing")))((("contact arcing, relays"))) the more the contacts will wear
due to arcing. At some point, a loaded relay might actually burn the contacts to the
point where they no longer make good contact. In other words, the contacts start
to become resistors, or even open circuits. This can be a major problem when a relay
is controlling an inductive load, such as a motor or another relay.

You can reduce arcing using a resistor-capacitor (RC) _snubbing_ circuit to help((("snubber, relay contact")))((("resistor-capacitor (RC) snubbing circuit")))
damp out the arc at the contacts. <<snubber>> shows one way to do this. This technique
works for both DC and AC circuits, and it can help extend the life of a relay's
contacts considerably.

[[snubber]]
.Relay contact snubber
image::images/pect_1011_mod.png[width="400",align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
Remember, if you need some assistance with the schematic symbols or electrical concepts
presented in this section, refer to <<Appendix_A>> or <<Appendix_B>>.
====

The idea behind a snubber is that the combination of R and C will reduce the effect
of spikes experienced by the relay contacts when power is removed from an inductive load,
in this case a motor (M). When current flow through an inductive load stops, the magnetic
field around the windings in the load will collapse, generating a large voltage spike.
The RC circuit acts to stretch the spike so that by the time it reaches its maximum
voltage, the relay contacts are far enough apart that an arc can't form between them.
<<Appendix_A>> includes the equations for calculating values for an RC circuit.

In some high-power contactors, the contacts are made from a silver alloy. Since
there will always be some arcing in high-current/high-voltage applications,
the contacts will start to oxidize. But with silver contacts, the result is
silver oxide, which is itself a decent pass:[<span class="keep-together">conductor.</span>]

==== Coil Overheating

Coil overheating will cause the coil((("relays", "reliability issues", "coil overheating")))((("coil overheating in relays"))) to deteriorate as the insulation becomes
brittle and breaks down. This will eventually result in shorts in the windings,
which will cause it to draw more current and get even hotter. It is not
unheard of for a relay to burst into flames when the coil severely overheats,
due to progressive shorts in the windings. The easiest way to avoid this
situation is to ensure that the relay isn't being driven with more than its
rated voltage. If possible, the circuit should be designed so that the default
state of the relay is off, not on. Putting a fuse in series with the coil of
a relay is another way to help prevent a catastrophic failure.

==== Relay Bounce

Just like a mechanical switch, the contacts of a relay have a tendency to bounce
when the relay closes.((("contact bounce", "in relays")))((("relays", "reliability issues", "contact bounce"))) The resulting output from the relay looks something like
<<relay_bounce>>.

[[relay_bounce]]
.Relay contact bounce
image::images/pect_1012.png[align="center"]

If a relay is connected to another relay, or to something like a lamp, LED, or
a motor, the contact bounce isn't a real big issue, except that it does prolong
contact arcing and subsequent wear (each bounce is an arc, even if tiny). The arc
suppression techniques mentioned earlier can help reduce the effects of contact bounce
on the relay contacts.

If a relay is connected to a digital circuit of some type (as an input, for
example), bounce can be a big problem. In a situation like this, the
input will need to be _debounced_, either((("debouncing, relay input"))) by logic hardware or by software.
Relay bounce can also sometimes be heard if a relay is switching an audio
signal. It's the "crunchy" blip or pop that occurs when the audio input is
switched from one source to another using a set of relays.

=== Relay Applications

Relays are useful for routing signals, switching current, or as a form of logic
for some applications.((("relays", "applications"))) While is it possible to use a solid-state component to
do switching and routing chores, the relay offers the advantage of low closed-circuit resistance, immunity to reverse current flow from inductive loads, and
the ability to act as an isolated control transition between low- and high-voltage pass:[<span class="keep-together">circuits.</span>]

[[relay_drivers]]
==== Controlling Relays with Low-Voltage Logic

A relay uses a coil to move the contacts,((("coils", "use by relays")))((("relays", "applications", "controlling relays with low-voltage logic"))) so it's an inductive load to whatever
is driving that coil.((("inductors"))) An inductor will produce a current in the reverse direction
when the energizing current ceases to flow and the magnetic field collapses, and
the resulting voltage spike can be quite large. A relay coil can also draw a
considerable amount of current, much more than most ICs can safely handle.

Some relays are made specifically for use with logic circuits, which means they will have a low coil-current (high resistance) and a built-in protection diode.
However, the coil-current general-purpose relays with 5V DC coils can range
anywhere from 20 to 80 mA, so this type of device should not be connected directly
to something like a TTL logic chip or a microcontroller without some kind of interface
circuit. The current through the coil will overwhelm the IC and probably damage it.
<<relay_driver_circuit>> shows one way to deal with this situation with an NPN transistor (a 2N2222A), a couple of resistors,((("transistors", "one-transistor relay driver")))((("integrated circuits (ICs)", "relay driver ICs"))) and a diode.

[[relay_driver_circuit]]
.Simple one-transistor relay driver
image::images/pect_1013_mod.png[width="400",align="center"]

This circuit is simple and effective, but relay driver ICs are also available
that package from one to eight relay driver circuits into a single chip.((("relay driver ICs"))) The single-channel
devices might be an option if you need to drive only one relay. <<relay_driver_ics>>
lists some of the available relay driver ICs.

Note that the parts in <<relay_driver_ics>> can be used to drive things other than a
relay, such as lamps, valves, actuator solenoids, high-current LED displays, and so on.
Also, many of the parts listed here will work with CMOS as well as TTL logic levels.
Check the datasheets from the manufacturers for details.

==== Signal Switching

<<signal_router>> shows a ((("relays", "applications", "signal switching")))((("signal switching", "using relays")))device (an HP 3488A switch/controller) that is
typically used to route signals between different types of measurement
equipment and devices or circuits under test. The switching is done by banks
of relays mounted on PCBs that plug into the rear of the unit. The 3488A can
be programmed to perform switching actions at specific times, but it can also
be controlled using a GPIB/IEEE-488 control interface to a PC or other control
device providing the commands to route signals through the relay banks.

[[signal_router]]
.The HP 3488A switch/controller unit
image::images/pect_1014.png[width="400",align="center"]

Small relays can be used to switch standard video signals or select inputs for
a measurement device. They were commonly used in the past to route telephone
circuits, although that function has been largely replaced by solid-state
components. For signal switching, reed relays are often used.

==== Power Switching

An example of using relays for((("relays", "applications", "power switching")))((("power switching", "using relays"))) power switching might be a situation where there
is a need to control things like pumps, valves, and heaters for a marine specimen
holding tank. Relays are a good choice for this, because a relay can operate a
120V AC pump as easily as a 12V DC pump. The main consideration would be the voltage
and current ratings for the contacts.

Air conditioning units employ heavy-duty contactors((("contactors", "heavy-duty, in air conditioners"))) to control various fans and
compressors. The input to the contactors is often a low voltage like 24 VAC that
is controlled by a thermostat. A conventional mechanical thermostat can be replaced
with a microcontroller and a relay to create a custom programmable controller
without the need to worry about creating a suitable circuit to interface directly
with the existing A/C control voltage.

==== Relay Logic

As mentioned earlier, some of the first computer-like systems were based on
relays.((("logic circuits", "using relays")))((("relays", "applications", "relay logic"))) It was a natural choice, given that the telephone switching networks were
starting to use relays for dynamic circuit routing. The rotary dial on old-style
telephones wasn't an aesthetic design decision; it was like that because each
pulse produced by the dial as it spun back to the start position drove a rotary
relay at a switching office somewhere. The caller effectively modified the
network wiring between her phone and whomever she was calling every time she
dialed a number. Multiple banks of rotary relays allowed simultaneous calls to go
through the system, and huge windowless buildings once held thousands or even tens
of thousands of relays, all chattering away at the same time.

[[relay_latching]]
[role="float-top wide"]
.Latching relay circuits with manual reset
image::images/pect_1015.png[align="center"]

Creating a latching circuit is((("latching relay circuits"))) straightforward, as shown in <<relay_latching>>.
In the simple design shown in circuit A, the relay is held closed by a second set
of contacts. Once the relay is energized, the current flow through the contacts
will keep it energized until the connection to ground is opened by the normally
closed switch. Note that this circuit will work for both AC and DC, up
to the maximum voltage that the switches and relay contacts can tolerate.

[role="pagebreak-before"]
The circuit in part B of <<relay_latching>> is intended for use with 5VDC only,
and it's basically just a variation on the driver circuit shown in <<relay_driver_circuit>>.
The main difference is that, when RY1 is energized, it will supply 5V back into
the transistor via the 1,000 (1k) ohm resistor, thus keeping it in an on state. When
the pushbutton switch is pressed, the base of the transistor will be grounded,
current flow through RY1 will stop, and the relay will open, thus breaking the
lock.

It's easy to ((("OR and AND relay logic circuits")))((("AND and OR relay logic circuits")))construct OR and AND logic using relays (see <<Chapter_11>> for more
about logic devices), as shown in <<relay_logic>>. There are other ways to get
the same results, using relays, but the idea here is to show how the standard
truth tables for OR and AND can be satisfied with just a couple of SPDT relays.
You can construct logic circuits for NOR, NAND, and XOR functions as well.

[[relay_logic]]
[role="float-top wide"]
.Simple OR and AND relay logic circuits
image::images/pect_1016.png[align="center"]

This isn't as esoteric as you might think, and relay logic appears in various
guises in circuits found in industrial controls, home appliances, automobiles, and
even in some avionics. Eventually, however, even these applications will become
the domain of solid-state controls and switches. But for now, relays are still very
much alive and well, and when you're dealing with the interfaces between systems operating
at vastly different voltage and current levels, a relay may be the easiest and
cheapest way to get the job done.

=== Summary

This chapter identified the three major types of relay mechanisms: armature,
reed, and contactor solenoid. It also covered some of the available package types,
including PCB, lug terminals, and sockets.

We also briefly examined some of the ways that relays can fail, and some of the
pass:[<span class="keep-together">techniques</span>] available to reduce the likelihood of failure. Lastly, we wrapped up
with a look a relay latching and relay logic.

You should come away from this chapter with a sense of what types of relays are
available and some of the ways they can be used. While it is beyond the scope of
this book to delve into the theory behind things like one-shot debounce timers and
