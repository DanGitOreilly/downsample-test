[[Chapter_4]] 
== Tool Techniques

This chapter discusses techniques that can be used((("tools", "techniques", id="ix_tooltechnique"))) with some of the tools introduced in
<<Chapter_3>> and ties in with the discussions on fasteners found in <<Chapter_2>>. Not
all of the tools from <<Chapter_3>> are covered here in detail, because the uses for many
of them are rather obvious. The objective is to expand on what was described in
<<Chapter_3>>, discuss some of the little details that are often overlooked, and check out
some of the less common tools.

In addition to the correct, and incorrect, use of common tools such as screwdrivers, this
chapter will also cover some ways to use and modify sockets and wrenches. We'll look at
how to solder various component types, with a special focus on surface-mounted components.
We'll also cover riveting and dealing with stubborn fasteners. Drills and drill bits get
a close look, along with the basics of cutting threads using taps and dies. An overview
of cutting methods for dealing with sheet, bar, and rod materials is provided, which
includes cut-off saws, hacksaws, the jeweler's saw, and rotary tools. We'll wrap up
with a look at a technique for using a rotary tool that might surprise you.

This chapter is by no means a comprehensive discussion of tool usage. It is merely a
summary of some useful techniques and things to look out for, along with a generous
amount of advice gleaned from my own experience and the experiences of others. What works
well for one person might not work well for another, and experience is the only way to
develop your own techniques. This chapter is intended to be a starting point for acquiring
that experience, or perhaps learning something new to add to what you already know.

[WARNING]
====
Some of the tools described in this chapter can severely injure you if used incorrectly
or carelessly. Always wear safety glasses when working with power tools, and always read
and follow the manufacturer's safety precautions provided with the tool. Use lubricant
when working with hard metals, and never reach into a running tool of any kind to clear
out metal or plastic chips. Shut the tool down first, and then clean it out. Remember
that a blob of molten solder can burn a deep hole in you, and even something as seemingly
innocent as a pocket knife can do some real damage.
====

=== Working with Fasteners

The fasteners((("fasteners", "working with, tool techniques")))((("tools", "techniques", "working with fasteners"))) described in <<Chapter_2>> are used with a variety of tools, which were
covered in <<Chapter_3>>. Choosing the correct screwdriver, hex wrench, or socket is
more important than you may think. When working with any kind of fastener, you must apply a significant amount of force on the head to rotate the screw or hold it in
place while threading a nut onto it. The wrong size or type of tool can slip, ruining
the part. Using a socket with a small socket-head bolt or nut where the socket doesn't
seat correctly can also result in a ruined fastener.

The upshot here is that the correct tool will fit the fastener snugly, with little or no
play, and it will turn or hold the fastener without damaging it. Inexpensive screwdriver
and hex wrench sets are readily available that contain a selection of tools of reasonable
quality, and the few dollars you'll spend is well worth it to avoid the aggravation of not
having the correct tool or needlessly damaging a fastener. Small sockets can be easily
modified to seat flush on a small nut or the head of a bolt, and both box and open wrenches
(also known as _spanners_) can((("wrenches")))((("spanners"))) be modified to fit into narrow spaces or work with low-profile
bolt heads and nuts.

==== Screwdriver Sizes and Types

Screwdrivers, like the ones introduced in <<Chapter_3>>, come ((("screwdrivers", "sizes and types")))((("fasteners", "working with, tool techniques", "screwdriver sizes and types")))in a range of standard
sizes. <<screwdriver_sizes>> lists commonly available screwdriver sizes for UTS/ANSI
screws, for((("screws", "standard sizes (UTS/ANSI)"))) both slot and Phillips types.

|================================================

For the #4, #6, and #8 screws commonly encountered in electronics, the #1 and #2
Phillips are the appropriate screwdriver sizes to use.((("screwdrivers", "Phillips"))) A #3 Phillips is
sometimes used to mount equipment in a 19-inch rack using 10&#8211;24 screws, and there
are cases where a heavy component (such as a power transformer, for example) is
mounted to a chassis using a 10-24 or 10-32 bolt or screw. The #4 size tools are
sometimes called for when you're dealing with things like large electrical distribution
panels and automotive pass:[<span class="keep-together">components</span>], but they aren't used much with electronic
devices. Most screwdriver sets include #1, #2, and #3 sizes, and the #0 or
#4 sizes can be purchased separately if they are needed.

Be careful not to((("Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) cross-drive screws")))((("JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) cross-drive screws"))) confuse JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) cross-drive screws
with Phillips drive parts. There is really nothing wrong with JIS screws and
JIS screwdrivers; they're just not fully compatible with Phillips-style hardware.((("screwdrivers", "JIS versus Phillips")))
JIS fasteners are commonly found in electronics imported from Asia. Some tool
vendors will sell imported JIS cross-drive screwdrivers as Phillips, when in
reality they are actually JIS tools.

The main difference between JIS and Phillips is that a JIS screwdriver will
handle a Phillips screw, but a Phillips screwdriver can wreck a JIS screw. So,
if you've been using a JIS driver on JIS screws without realizing it, and then
reach for a Phillips one day on the assumption that they are all the same, you
may be in for a rude surprise in the form of a ruined JIS screw that you'll have to drill out or cut off to remove (this is discussed in detail
in <<stubborn_fasteners>>).

<<jis_vs_phillips_heads>> shows the difference between the JIS and Phillips screw heads.((("screws", "JIS versus Phillips heads"))) Note the rounded corners of the Phillips screw, whereas the JIS has
sharp right angles at the intersection. <<jis_vs_phillips>> shows the difference
between JIS and Phillips drivers. Note that the blades on the JIS tool are
slightly shorter than the Phillips one, because the slots on a JIS screw are not
as deep as on a Phillips screw.

[[jis_vs_phillips_heads]]
.JIS versus Phillips screw heads
image::images/pect_0401.png[width=200]

[[jis_vs_phillips]]
.JIS versus Phillips drivers
image::images/pect_0402.png[width=200]

The rounded corners at the slot intersection on the Phillips screw, along with the
rounded blades on the driver, cause the tip of the screwdriver to "cam out" when
the screw is fully seated and no more motion is possible. It's an intentional design
feature. The JIS tool, on the other hand, is not designed to lift out of the screw
head. A Phillips screwdriver will not seat correctly in a JIS-type screw, and it might
round off the corners of the slot intersection on a JIS part.

<<using_Philips>> shows how to check the size and fit of a Phillips screwdriver for a
given screw,((("Phillips screwdrivers", "checking size and fit for a given screw"))) in this case a 6-32. Note that the #2 screwdriver on the left fits the
screw, whereas the #1 tool on the right is a little too small. It might work, but the
risk of damaging the screw head is much higher.

[[using_Philips]]
.Phillips screwdriver sizing
image::images/pect_0403.png[width="400",align="center"]

Here's why all of this matters: a Phillips screw with the slots twisted out of the head
can be a real hassle to remove. <<damaged_Philips>> shows a damaged Phillips screw on the right, with an undamaged part on the left for comparison. The parts
are identical in terms of size and threads, but one is now completely ruined. The damage
shown in <<damaged_Philips>> can occur when a screwdriver tip is too small for the
screw head, or the screwdriver was allowed to bounce in and out of the head slots after
it would have normally cammed out. This is always a potential risk when you are using some type
of powered driver, but not so much when you're driving a screw by hand.

[[damaged_Philips]]
.Damaged Phillips screw
image::images/pect_0404.png[width="400", align="center"]

Because a tool that is too large won't fit correctly in the first place, it should be
readily apparent that continuing would be a bad idea (although I have seen people try
it and, as expected, end up with a ruined screw head). The importance of correct tool
sizing also applies to slotted head fasteners, but as stated elsewhere, these really
should be avoided if at all possible.

If you are using a power driver with screws,((("screwdrivers", "power", "avoiding damage to screws"))) you should be particularly careful. I have
a used Ingersoll-Rand industrial driver that I'm quite fond of, but unless the torque
is set correctly, it can ruin the head of a screw in the blink of an eye. A cordless
drill can also damage a screw (as anyone who has ever used one for drywall installation
or woodworking can attest), and even a small hand-held driver like the one shown in
<<small_driver>> can ruin the head of a screw if used carelessly.

[[small_driver]]
.Battery-operated electric screwdriver
image::images/pect_0405.png[width="300", align="center"]

If used carefully,((("electric screwdrivers", "battery-powered"))) a battery-operated screwdriver like the one shown in <<small_driver>>
can make your life a lot easier. If you do decide to purchase one, get a good one,
preferably rechargeable. The own shown here uses AA size batteries, which occasionally
will need to be replaced.

[[self_tapping_screws_ch04]]
==== Self-Tapping Screws

<<Chapter_2>> covered self-tapping screws, but ((("self-tapping screws", "techniques for working with")))((("fasteners", "working with, tool techniques", "self-tapping screws")))it's worth mentioning again
that they can be problematic to work with. Once a self-tapping screw has been removed,
it's easy to drive it back in and destroy the threads it cut the first time. This
is called _cross-threading_, and((("cross-threading"))) it's generally a bad thing.

There is a trick you can try to get a self-tapping screw to line up with the
threads it cut into the material when it was first installed. First, put the screw
into the hole without tightening it. Then, holding it in place with a slight amount
of pressure on the screwdriver, turn the screw the "wrong" way (i.e., counter clockwise),
as if you were backing it out. At some point, you should feel a slight "bump" when the
start of the thread is encountered (if you are working with metal, you might even hear
a faint click).

Now, immediately after the bump or click, turn the screw the correct direction to tighten
it (clockwise), and it should pick up the threads and go in without cross-threading. Do
not apply a lot of pressure when reseating a self-tapping screw; just let the existing
threads pull it in and apply only moderate pressure when it stops to tighten it.

This little trick works best with plastics and thick sheet metal. With thin sheet metal,
you might not have much of anything in the way of threads to work with, but it's still
worth a shot.

==== Hex-Socket-Head Fasteners and Hex Wrenches

A hex wrench (also called a _hex key_ or _Allen wrench_) doesn't((("fasteners", "working with, tool techniques", "hex-socket-head fasteners and hex wrenches")))((("hex wrenches", "working with, techniques"))) have a tendency to climb out
of the hex socket in the way a screwdriver will with a Phillips or slotted screw.
<<using_hex_wrench>> shows a hex wrench being used with a small cap-head bolt. Note
that getting the wrench end fully seated in the hex socket is the secret to success.

[[using_hex_wrench]]
.Using a hex wrench
image::images/pect_0406.png[width="300",align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
A screwdriver is not a hex wrench, and((("screwdrivers", "improperly using with hex-socket-head fasteners"))) trying to use one to tighten or loosen a
fastener with a hex socket in the head will not do it any favors. Once the interior
edges of the socket are damaged, a hex wrench will no longer seat correctly and the
part is essentially useless. Inexpensive hex wrench sets appear often enough on the
"bargain table" in hardware stores that there really isn't a good reason not to own
one.
====

Typically, both ends of a common hex wrench are usable, as shown in <<hex_wrench_torque>>.((("hex wrenches", "working with, techniques", "using both ends, torque and")))
Using the "short" end allows you to apply greater torque to the fastener by applying
pressure to the long arm of the tool. Inserting the long end of the wrench into the hex
socket won't allow for as much torque, but it does make it easier to spin the tool between
your fingers and get the screw or bolt moving a lot faster.

[[hex_wrench_torque]]
.Different torque and movements possible with each end of a hex wrench
image::images/pect_0407.png[width="250",align="center"]

One way to take advantage of both ends of a hex wrench is to use the short end to break a
fastener free and then flip the tool and use the long end to spin the fastener out. A
simple concept, to be sure, but one that might not be intuitively obvious to those who
haven't worked with hex wrenches before.

If you examine different sets of hex wrenches, you might notice that some of them have flat
ends, whereas others have a rounded shape like a ball. The wrench shown in <<using_hex_wrench>>
is a ball-end hex wrench, and <<hex_wrench_torque>> shows a flat-end type. <<hex_ends>> shows
a side-by-side comparison((("hex wrenches", "working with, techniques", "ball- and flat-end hex wrenches")))((("wrenches", "ball- and flat-end wrenches"))) of ball- and flat-end hex wrenches.

[[hex_ends]]
.Ball-end and flat-end (straight shaft) hex wrenches
image::images/pect_0408.png[width="250",align="center"]

Flat-end (or _straight-shaft_) wrenches can((("straight-shaft wrenches")))((("flat-end (straight-shaft) wrenches"))) tolerate higher amounts of torque and make more
complete contact with the insides of the hex socket. ((("ball-end wrenches")))A ball-end wrench is convenient for
getting into tight spaces, but the ball doesn't make as much physical contact with the
inner walls of the socket and the narrow section (the waist) of the wrench end might break
under stress. Some people like to use the flat-end wrenches to initially loosen a part
and then use a ball-end wrench to turn it out. Conversely, a ball-end wrench can be used
to turn a fastener into position, and then a flat end wrench can be used to fully tighten it.

When using very small hex wrenches, be careful not to apply too much force. The wrench shaft
might snap under excessive torque, and while this won't usually damage the fastener, it does
destroy a tool. Along the same lines, never use a hex driver in a power tool, such as an
electric screwdriver or a cordless drill, unless the power tool has an adjustable torque
limit. A hex wrench can apply enough torque to a fastener to twist the head off, leaving
you just a threaded stub to deal with.

==== Hex-Head Fasteners and Socket Wrenches

Socket wrenches ((("socket wrenches", "using with hex-head fasteners")))((("fasteners", "working with, tool techniques", "hex-head fasteners and socket wrenches")))come in both ratcheted and nonratcheted (direct-drive) forms. The use of
the ratchet drive makes the tool less tedious to operate, and it also permits its use in
restricted spaces. The socket wrench set shown in <<socket_and_hex_drivers>> is a typical example.
Some socket kits also include a screwdriver-type handle, which is handy for getting into
tight spots, but it can't really apply the same amount of torque that a ratchet can
supply.

Another variation is a direct-drive handle, ((("socket wrenches", "using with hex-head fasteners", "direct-drive and ratchet-drive handles")))which employs the mechanical advantage of a lever
but does not incorporate a ratchet. <<qtr_drive>> illustrates the difference between a
ratchet drive and a direct-drive socket tool handle. From left to right, we have a ratchet,
a swivel-end direct-drive handle, a sliding bar handle, and a six-inch extension. These are
all designed to work with sockets that accept a 1/4-inch drive. Many socket sets include both
1/2-inch and 1/4-inch drive sockets, along with a 1/4-inch drive handle that looks like a screwdriver,
and a 1/2-inch to 1/4-inch adapter.

[[qtr_drive]]
.1/4&#34; drive socket handles and extension
image::images/pect_0409.png[width="400",align="center"]

An extension is useful if you need to get at a bolt that is beyond the reach of the wrench.
<<socket_extension>> shows an extension adapter for a 1/2" drive tool. It's the same
idea as the one shown in <<qtr_drive>>, only larger.

[[socket_extension]]
.Socket wrench with extension
image::images/pect_0410.png[width="300",align="center"]

[WARNING]
====
Using pliers of any kind on a screw or bolt intended for use with a socket wrench is a((("pliers", "improper use with screws or bolts instead of a socket wrench")))
sure-fire way to round off the edges of the head so that no socket will ever work with
it again. Some types of pliers have a toothed section supposedly for use on hex-head
parts. Don't use it unless it's an emergency.
====

A socket wrench can apply considerable force to a fastener.((("socket wrenches", "using with hex-head fasteners", "too much torque"))) Be careful not to get too
carried away and over-torque the part. The part might be difficult to remove at some
future point in time, or even worse, the head of the bolt could shear off, leaving you
with a headless bolt and a real problem. If there is a lock washer under the head or the
nut, excessive torque can reduce its effectiveness.

A socket should fit snugly on the head of a hex-head bolt or screw, with little or no
play (or wiggle). <<Chapter_2>> discussed how a small hex-head fastener, such as a bolt
or machine screw, can be difficult to drive if a socket does not seat flush around the
head. _Small_, in this case, means 9/32 of an inch or 7 millimeters, and smaller, and sockets
in this size range are usually 1/4-inch drive types.

Most common inexpensive sockets have a slightly rounded edge and angled faces at the entry
of the socket that will prevent the socket from fully seating on the sides of the head of
a small fastener or bolt with a low-profile head. Consequently, the tool could easily slip
and damage the head. <<socket_seating>> illustrates this situation. Note how an
unmodified (stock) socket doesn't seat flush on a small hex-head bolt or screw.((("socket wrenches", "using with hex-head fasteners", "flush seating, modifying socket for"))) In some
cases, it can be even more extreme than what is shown here.

[[socket_seating]]
.Socket seating on a small hex-head fastener
image::images/pect_0411.png[width="250",align="center"]

You can modify sockets by grinding off about 1/16 to 3/32 of an inch of the end of the
socket, or up to where the interior angles end. The leaves a flat surface at the entry of
the socket for the head of the fastener to fit into. <<modified_sockets>> shows sockets before and after such a modification.

[[modified_sockets]]
.Small sockets before and after flush seating modification
image::images/pect_0412.png[width="300",align="center"]

Now the modified socket will seat flush on the head of the fastener, as shown in the bottom
illustration in <<socket_seating>>. This isn't something I'd recommend for sockets larger than
about 9/32 inch or 7 millimeters in size. Since the heads on larger fasteners tend to be taller and have
more available surface area for the socket to contact, the modification really isn't necessary.

==== Adjustable Wrenches

In general, an adjustable wrench is a bad idea,((("wrenches", "adjustable")))((("fasteners", "working with, tool techniques", "adjustable wrenches")))((("adjustable wrenches"))) unless you are doing plumbing. But
sometimes there is just no other way to get the job done due to space constraints
or lack of other available tools. If used correctly and only occasionally, an adjustable
wrench isn't necessarily bad, but it can be used badly.

If you are going to keep an adjustable wrench in your tool kit, make sure it is a good one.
This is one tool you don't want to pick up from the bargain bin, and you should have a
selection of sizes. In addition to single tools, adjustable wrenches often come in sets of
four with 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-inch wrenches. Specialty outlets carry 4-inch wrenches, as well.
The wrench should have minimal play in the adjustable jaw, operate smoothly without sticking
or binding, and look like some care went into its manufacture (forged with smooth machined
surfaces).

<<adj_wrench_parts>> shows the parts of a typical adjustable wrench. The worm drive moves
the adjustable jaw in a track cut into the fixed jaw. The adjustable jaw is made so that
the seat area will expand or contract while maintaining the correct angle to allow a hex-head bolt to seat correctly. Should you happen to encounter an adjustable wrench that does
not maintain the correct angle in the seat, I would recommend tossing it into the
recycle bin and getting a better tool.

[[adj_wrench_parts]]
.Parts of a typical adjustable wrench
image::images/pect_0413.png[width="300",align="center"]

If you do elect to use an adjustable wrench, you should make sure that the jaws are
tight on the part, and be prepared to stop periodically to check that they remain
tight.((("bolts", "adjustable wrench, using on a large bolt"))) An adjustable wrench that slips is a fast way to ruin a hex nut or hex-head
fastener. <<adjustable_wrench>> shows a typical adjustable wrench being used on a
large bolt.

[[adjustable_wrench]]
.A typical adjustable wrench in use
image::images/pect_0414.png[width="300",align="center"]

There's a problem with how the wrench in <<adjustable_wrench>> is being used: it
isn't fully seated against the bolt head. Notice that there is a gap between the
head of the nut and wrench seat. The bolt head or nut should be as far back against
the seat of the wrench as possible.

As with just about any tool, there is a right way and a wrong way to use it. The
adjustable wrench is no exception, as <<using_adj_wrench>> shows.

[[using_adj_wrench]]
.Right and wrong ways to use an adjustable wrench
image::images/pect_0415.png[width="300",align="center"]

==== Wrenches (Spanners)

In electronics work, there is usually not much call for a((("wrenches", "spanners")))((("spanners")))((("fasteners", "working with, tool techniques", "wrenches (spanners)"))) box or open wrench, but as
described in <<Chapter_3>>, small tools are available. <<mini_wrenches>> shows
a set of small open wrenches, ranging from 13/64 to 5/16 inch in size. These are old, so
finding a set like this again might take some digging around in a used tool shop.

[[mini_wrenches]]
.Set of small dual-size open wrenches
image::images/pect_0416.png[width="300",align="center"]

<<mini_combo_wrenches>> shows a more modern set. These are more conventional
combination wrenches, with an open wrench on one end and a box wrench on the other.((("combination wrenches")))((("wrenches", "spanners", "combination box and open wrench")))
These range from 1/4 to 5/16 inch in size. Small metric sizes are also available.

[[mini_combo_wrenches]]
.Set of small combination wrenches
image::images/pect_0417.png[width="300",align="center"]

When you are working with a small wrench, it helps to keep pressure on the tool while it is in
contact with the head of the fastener. A finger can be used for this purpose, although
a small wood dowel or wood block will also work. Because the working faces of a box or
open wrench typically have slightly rounded edges from the forging process used to
manufacture them, they might not seat completely on the head of a small fastener. The width
of the tool might also prevent it from reaching into tight spaces, such as when you are making an
adjustment to something.

The set shown in <<mini_wrenches>> is unique in that the wrenches are already thin and relatively
flat, but this is more the exception than the rule.((("wrenches", "spanners", "modifying to make thinner"))) You can modify (hack, if you will) a small wrench to make it thinner by carefully grinding both sides of the open end of the
wrench. <<modified_wrench_before>> shows a wrench prior to modification.

[[modified_wrench_before]]
.Unmodified small 1/4&#34; wrench
image::images/pect_0418.png[width="300",align="center"]

A bench grinder was used to flatten the surfaces of the wrench shown in <<modified_wrench_after>>,
and the ground surfaces were then smoothed with a semi-abrasive buffing wheel. This
technique can also be applied to the box end of the wrench. In case you're curious,
this was done to a cheap 1/4-inch wrench that happened to be lying about, not doing much.

[[modified_wrench_after]]
.Modified small 1/4&#34; wrench
image::images/pect_0419.png[width="300",align="center"]

There's nothing wrong with hacking tools to make them fit your needs. Just be aware that,
once modified, the tool will never be the same. But that's all right if you really need it
and don't mind potentially sacrificing a tool. I generally keep a number of sacrificial
tools on hand that I pick up from the bargain bin at the hardware store or scrounge up at
one of the local second-hand tool stores. I wouldn't do this to an expensive tool unless
there was a desperate need.

[[Rivets_ch04]]
==== Rivets

Using a blind rivet is simple and the technique is relatively((("rivets", "working with, techniques")))((("fasteners", "working with, tool techniques", "rivets"))) easy to master. In addition
to different diameters, blind rivets also come in different lengths, called the _grip depth_.((("grip depth (rivets)")))
The thickness of the parts to be joined determines the necessary grip depth.
<<using_blind_rivet_pt1>> shows a blind rivet being set into a steel panel, and
<<using_blind_rivet_pt2>> shows the rivet in place with the stem (or tensioning rod) cut
free by the riveting tool. The tensioning rod is still in the barrel of the tool and will

.Installing a blind rivet: rivet set and pass:[<span class="keep-together">stem cut</span>]
image::images/pect_0421.png[width="300",align="center"]

There are four basic steps involved in((("rivets", "working with, techniques", "installing a blind rivet"))) installing a blind rivet:

 . Drill holes in both pieces to be joined at the location where the rivet will
be placed.
 . Insert the rivet into the riveting tool.
 . Insert the rivet body though the holes in the pieces to be joined.
 . Pull the handle until the tool trims off the rivet's tensioning rod.

<<rivet_installation>> shows what is going on when a blind rivet is set. It also shows
the two main measurements of a rivet: diameter and grip. The size of the hole in the
material to be joined depends on the diameter of the rivet to be installed, which itself
depends on how much load the riveted joint will need to bear. It is essential to make a hole
that is just large enough for the rivet body to pass through, but not so large that the
rivet is loose in the hole.

[[rivet_installation]]
[role="float-top wide"]
.Blind rivet installation details
image::images/pect_0422_mod.png[width="300"]

The _grip depth_ is how thick the material can be for a given rivet size.((("grip depth (rivets)"))) Note that the
grip depth is always less than the length of the rivet body. Blind rivets have a specified
minimum and maximum grip. The minimum grip is the point at which a shorter length rivet
may be used. A given rivet can be used with material that is less than the minimum grip
depth, but it will cause the rivet body to "bunch" on the blind side. This might create a
problem with other parts, and it can result in a less-than-optimal joint. In some cases, the
tool might not be able to pull the tensioning rod out far enough to snap it off, which can
be a hassle to deal with. If the grip depth is less than the minimum for a particular rivet,
consider using the next shorter size.

The _maximum grip_ is the thickest((("maximum grip (rivets)"))) combination of materials the rivet can reliably and
properly hold together. Do not use a rivet with a maximum grip that is less than the
actual depth. When the rivet is set, it will not expand the blind side sufficiently to
solidly and reliably join the pieces.

Some blind rivet tools come with a handy hole-sizing chart, along with a selection of
rivets to start off with. Small rivets won't take as much stress as larger parts, and
there is always the chance that a small rivet might be torn loose under extreme duress.
A blind rivet can be used with soft materials such as plastic or even canvas if a backing
washer is used to distribute the force exerted by the rivet. Some types of rivets are
made with extended flanges for these types of applications. The rivets are cheap, so if
you have a blind rivet tool, you really should have a good selection of rivets in
different diameters and grip depths to go with it. Make sure you also have the correct
drill bits to make the holes for the rivets.

[[stubborn_fasteners]]
==== Dealing with Stubborn Fasteners

Work with fasteners long enough, and at some point you will inevitably encounter a((("fasteners", "working with, tool techniques", "dealing with stubborn fasteners"))) stubborn
fastener that simply refuses to move. Here are some techniques for dealing
with these situations.

===== Solvents

Using the solvent WD-40 can sometimes loosen parts that are bound by corrosion.((("WD-40", "using to loosen stubborn fasteners")))((("solvents", "using to deal with stubborn fasteners")))
There are also other solvents sold for this purpose. Use a cotton swab or small eye
dropper to apply it to the base of the head of the stuck fastener.

[NOTE]
====
Bear in mind that WD-40 is not really a good general-purpose lubricant. It is primarily a
penetrating oil and was originally developed for water displacement and metal protection
for military equipment, such as missiles and aircraft. It's also good for noisy door hinges,
but it will dissolve heavier lubricants like motor oil and grease. Using it on something
like a bicycle chain or a bearing is not a good idea.
====

Parts that have been sitting for a long time sometimes become "frozen" or "seized" in a
threaded hole. One way to break them loose, in addition to applying a solvent, is to tap
them. Do this using a small punch and a ball-peen hammer. A few taps might be all that is
needed to break the part loose and get it moving. Just be careful not to damage the
drive slots or the hex-socket hole in the head of the screw or bolt.

===== Torque

When you are dealing with a tight screw, ((("torque", "using to dislodge stubborn fasteners")))it sometimes helps to apply a quick, sharp "snap" of
force to the tool to break the bolt or screw loose. This requires a solid
fit between the tool and the screw. Be careful not to apply an excessive amount of
force, or you could be left with either a broken tool or a headless bolt or screw.

===== Temperature

In some cases, you can loosen a stuck fastener just enough to remove it by cooling it
relative to the surrounding material.((("temperature", "cooling stubborn fasteners in order to loosen them")))((("freeze spray"))) A can of so-called _freeze spray_ (used in
electronics to find temperature-sensitive parts) can suit this purpose. The
trick is to apply the coolant directly to the head of the fastener and the metal
immediately surrounding it after first applying a solvent. Cool the fastener and
the surrounding area until it begins to develop frost, and then use the appropriate
tool as quickly as possible. The objective is for the fastener and the hole it is in to
contract; the fastener will become slightly smaller in diameter and the diameter of
the hole will increase slightly (this might be counterintuitive, but it does work).

===== Drilling and Grinding

As a true last-resort measure, you can sometimes remove a stuck fastener by drilling
out the head or grinding it off.((("screws and bolts", "drilling or grinding off the head to remove when stuck")))((("drilling out the head of stuck fasteners")))((("grinding off the head of stuck fasteners"))) If it is a flat-head screw, then drilling is about
the only option. The trick is to drill out enough of the old screw head to pull the
pieces it is holding apart, but not so much as to dig into the countersink below the
head. <<drilling_out_screw>> shows how this is done.

[[drilling_out_screw]]
.Drilling out the head of a counter-sunk screw
image::images/pect_0423.png[width="300",align="center"]

The top image in <<drilling_out_screw>> shows the drill cutting into the head of the
stuck screw. Notice that the diameter of the drill bit is slightly larger than the
diameter of the screw shaft. In the bottom image, you can see what is left of the head
of the screw on the drill bit. The operation was a success. You can remove what is left of
the screw using pliers. Since the objective is to get the old screw
shank out and discard it, you can be as rough with it as necessary.

For screws and bolts with raised heads (pan, cap, and such), it is possible to grind
off the head of the fastener using a tool like a right-angle grinder (such as the one
shown in <<grinders>>). Just be careful not to let the grinder make contact with the
underlying metal any more than necessary, and even then, some sanding and buffing might
be needed to clean up the area. The end result of both procedures is the same: the
shank of a now headless screw or bolt will be left that can then be removed and
discarded.

=== Soldering and Desoldering

Soldering is the quintessential activity of electronics.((("soldering"))) One of the first odors you might
notice when walking into an active electronics shop or lab is the smell of the hot flux
from the solder wire. Almost every component used in electronics can be connected using
solder in one form or another.

==== Solder Types

Solder is an alloy of two or more metals. In the past, the typical formulation used tin and
lead, although nowadays other metals are found in alloys for lead-free solder or special
applications requiring high conductivity or strength. The ratio of the component metals
varies, depending on the application. In the past, the most common alloy for electronics
work was a 60/40 blend of tin and lead (Sn60/Pb40). Another common type has a ratio of 63/37,
which has a slightly lower melting point. For plumbing applications involving copper tubing
and copper pipes, the ratio is usually 50/50, with a much higher melting point that requires a torch or
a substantial soldering tool.

Early on, soldering was used to join copper tubing and the seams of tin cans, and then
made the transition to electronics because of its ability to easily create strong,
electrically conductive bonds between the metallic leads of components. Because of its
lead content, solder was phased out of use in plumbing in the 1980s. Since 2006, lead-based
solder has been phased out of most consumer electronics production, as well, although
it is still common in high-reliability, aerospace, military, and hobbyist applications.
Lead-free formulations are usually some variation of pass:[<span class="keep-together">tin-copper</span>] (Sn-Cu) or tin-silver-copper
(Sn-Aq-Cu). The lead-free types have different melting points than Sn-Pb formulations,
although modern soldering irons can easily deal with this. The main issues with RoHS
(restriction of hazardous substances--i.e., lead-free) solders involve ease of use and
long-term reliability.

Although many people worry about the lead in solder, it's really not as big a hazard
as some might think. In the solder alloy form, the lead is quite stable and poses a
minimal hazard if handled properly. The primary concern is ingesting lead.
Fermilab (the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory) has a http://bit.ly/solder-hazard[web page on lead solder hazards]. The main points
are to never eat or drink anything while working with solder, and be sure to wash
your hands after using it. In fact, it's always a good idea to wash
your hands after doing anything on the workbench, since the lead in solder isn't the
only potentially hazardous material found around electronics.

In an http://bit.ly/lead-free[editorial in the journal _ECN_], Jon Titus provides a quick overview of the impacts
of making the transition to lead-free solders, most of which have been either neutral
or negative.
One major point is that to date there has been no data to indicate that lead-based
solder is a major contributor to levels of free lead in the environment. The second
major point is that lead-free solder joints can be less reliable and and are prone to
introducing problems such as "tin whiskers," which can lead to long-term reliability
issues. The original advocates of lead-free solder admit that this is indeed the case.
Another interesting editorial, appearing in _Electronic Design News_ (EDN) in 2007,
http://bit.ly/ROHS-myths[listed and debunked some of the myths surrounding RoHS solder].

If you want to use RoHS solder, there are two main types available. A tin-copper alloy
(99.3% Sn, 0.7% Cu) with a flux core is readily available in spools of various sizes.
The flux used is the same for both tin-lead and RoHS solders, being either rosin-based
or water-soluble. Sn-Ag-Cu (tin-silver-copper) solders are used by a majority of
Japanese manufacturers for reflow, wave, and hand soldering in production environments.
Kester has a http://bit.ly/hand-solder[good write-up on the use of RoHS solder for hand soldering].

The RoHS solders tend to not flow as smoothly as tin-lead (Sn-Pb) solder, and most types
require a slightly higher working temperature (between 5 to 25 degrees C higher than with Sn-Pb
solder). For this reason, some sources recommend that the beginner start off with a Sn-Pb
solder and then make the transition to RoHS after gaining some soldering skill.

Although RoHS solder has seen improvements over the past few years, there are still some
potential issues with tin whiskers, and because of the inherent properties of the metals
involved, it will always be slightly more difficult to work with than lead-based solder.
What type you choose to use is up to you.

[NOTE]
====
When you are working with any solder, there will be some smoke. This is not the solder itself,
as the soldering temperatures are not high enough to vaporize the metals in the solder.
The smoke is coming from the flux. It's still not a good idea to breathe a lot of it,
so having a small fan on the workbench will disperse it. Don't waste your money on
a soldering iron with a "fume collector" attachment. These usually don't work (except
for the really expensive industrial-grade tools), and in any case, a cheap fan from the
local drugstore will blow the fumes away and keep you cool at the same time.
====

Tin-lead solder is still readily available and easy to work with and, provided that you
don't ingest any, relatively safe to use. For electronics work, the most common
form of solder is a wire with a hollow core filled with a flux material, typically some
type of rosin (similar to what violinists use on their bows). <<solder_spool>> shows a
one-pound spool of rosin flux core solder. RoHS solder is also available in spools like the
one shown in <<solder_spool>>.

[[solder_spool]]

For working with surface-mounted components, _solder paste_ is essential. This is basically
ground solder with flux and a binding agent that can be applied to the component mounting
locations on a circuit board using an applicator. Solder paste is available in RoHS
formulations as well as conventional tin-lead. Some solder paste comes in tubes that
allow you to squeeze out what you need, or you can find it in small containers with screw-on
lids. <<solder_paste>> shows a tube of solder paste with a set of spare applicator tips.

[[solder_paste]]

image::images/pect_0425.png[width="500",align="center"]

==== Soldering Technique

<<Chapter_3>> covers soldering tools--namely, the soldering iron and soldering
stations. If you want or need to work with lead-free solder, then investing in a good
temperature-controlled soldering station would be a good idea. A selection of different
tip sizes is also wise, since in some cases a fine tip is necessary (e.g., for
surface-mount work). In other cases, you might need to apply much more heat (e.g., soldering
to the terminals on a large toggle switch), so a large point or chisel tip would be
appropriate.

===== Temperature

One of the questions that often comes up regarding soldering is how hot the tip should be.
A general answer might that the tip of the soldering iron should be as hot as necessary
to melt the solder and create a solid joint without damaging the part being soldered
(or the underlying PCB). Fortunately, soldering has been around for a while, so there
is a sizable body of knowledge (and advice) available to draw upon.

The melting point of 60/40 tin-lead solder is around 374°F (190°C), but the tip of the
soldering iron needs to be much hotter than that, because it will cool rapidly when
applied to the parts to be soldered. However, if the temperature is too high (as is
sometimes the case with cheap, unregulated irons), the solder might not flow correctly,
and the tip of the iron might not wet (take a thin initial layer of solder) properly.

Some sources recommend a tip temperature of around 700°F (370°C). For some work, you might
want it hotter--for example, when soldering 18-gauge wire to a large switch or high-current
connector of some type. If you are using RoHS solder, the tip will need to be hotter
to adequately melt the solder. A hot iron will allow a connection to be made more quickly,
which means the tip of the iron is in contact with the work for a shorter period of time
than if the temperature were lower.

Another approach is to set the temperature to around 550°F (260°C) and increase it until
you obtain the desired result. But bear in mind that if the temperature is too low,
you risk damaging something because of the extended time necessary to heat the
joint to the point where the solder will flow. The objective is to find the temperature
range that works for you in typical situations. If you have a soldering station with a
digital readout, I suggest keeping a list of temperatures for different tips and
types of soldering activities, which you have determined for yourself, taped up near it.

===== Soldering Wires

Soldering can take some practice to master. Unfortunately, it is not as simple as just
applying some heat and daubing on some solder. When you are soldering, you are, in effect,
brazing, albeit at a low temperature. The idea is to get the work (the parts to be
soldered) hot enough to let the solder melt and flow across and between them. The solder
forms a bond with the metal of the components being soldered and becomes hard after it
has been heated. <<soldering_switch>> shows a wire being attached to the connector lug
of a small pushbutton switch.

[[soldering_switch]]
.Soldering wires to a switch
image::images/pect_0426.png[width="300",align="center"]

After the wires have been soldered to the switch, the solder lugs are covered with
heatshrink tubing, as shown in <<finished_switch>>. This protects the connections
and prevents things from accidentally making contact with them. Using heatsink on a
bare connection like this is always a good idea, even though it is an extra step.

[[pcb_soldering]]
===== Soldering a PCB

Soldering parts to a printed circuit board can be challenging. Unlike wires, the
components on a PCB tend to be heat sensitive, so leaving the soldering iron on the
connection for too long can potentially do some damage. <<soldering_pcb>> shows a
component being soldered to a PCB.

[role="wide"]
.Using Heatshrink Tubing
*************************
Heatshrink tubing, also known as just _heatshrink_, is amazing stuff. It comes in a wide
range of sizes, colors, and types. It's easy to cut, simple to use, and it does just what the
name implies: it shrinks. It is used in everything from electric golf carts to computers.
Anywhere that electrical tape might have been used in the past is a possible application
for heatshrink tubing. The only somewhat tricky part about using heatshrink is getting
it hot enough to shrink without damaging it or the components and wires around it.

As a general rule of thumb, it is safe to assume that a peice of common heatshrink will
shrink to 1/2 of its original diameter, although some types can shrink to 1/4 of the
original diameter or more. When heatshink is hot, it will self-adhere, and it has been
used to create things like a temporary cap for a low-pressure gas line by crimping the
open end of the heatshrink while it is still hot and pliable. It can also be used to
seal an assembly inside. <<Chapter_12>> describes a homemade optical isolator encased
in a section of heatshrink.

As shown in <<finished_switch>>, a section of heatshrink was placed on each of the
wires before soldering started. After the wire was soldered to the terminal of the
switch and the solder joint was cleaned up, the heatshrink was moved down over the
soldered terminal. A hot-air gun was then used to activate the heatshrink. Notice how
the heatshrink extends from the terminal by about 1/3 of an inch or so along the wire.
Since heatshrink becomes rigid after it has been heated, this serves as a strain
relief for the wire. It also forms a seal around the wire to keep dirt and moisture out.

Using a cigarette lighter or a hot soldering iron is not a recommended way to
work with heatshrink. Special hot-air blowers are available for just this type of
application, and the desoldering/reflow blower on an SMT (surface-mount technology) workstart will also do a
good job if used carefully. Too much heat can cause the tubing to split or melt, and
it can do some serious collateral damage. Most common household hair dryers won't get
hot enough to do the job. If you plan to work with heatshrink on a regular basis,
you might want to consider purchasing an inexpensive hot-air blower. The hot-air
blowers used for sweat soldering by plumbers will also work, but you have to pay
close attention, as they run really hot.

The best way to learn how to work with heatshrink, and perhaps get some novel ideas
for ways to use it, is to buy some and play with it. Heatshrink is not very expensive.
Kits with various diameters and types are readily available online, and a local
electronics outlet should have some available, as well.

[[soldering_pcb]]
.Soldering a component to a PCB
image::images/pect_0428.png[width="300",align="center"]

The place on a PCB where the lead of a component goes through is called a _pad_. A
hole that exists in a PCB solely for the purpose of connecting one layer to another
(like a vertical jumper of sorts) is called a _via_. PCBs come in single-layer, double-sided,
and multilayer forms. <<Chapter_15>> discusses the design of PCBs.

In <<soldering_pcb>>, you can see that the solder is applied to the point where the tip of
the soldering iron meets both the component lead and the connection pad on the PCB. This
happens to be a single-sided PCB, which can be slightly more difficult to solder than a
double-sided PCB. In this case, the flux core in the solder was sufficient to help create
a solid connection, but sometimes additional flux helps. <<soldered_comp>> shows the result for two components (a
resistor and a small diode on the other side).

[[soldered_comp]]
.Component soldered to a single-sided PCB
image::images/pect_0429.png[width="300",align="center"]

A single-sided PCB can be tricky to solder, since there is little reason for the solder to
wick down into the hole alongside the component lead. This can result in an incomplete
connection, where only a part of the component lead is actually soldered and the solder
flows around the rest of the lead without bonding.

It is not uncommon for the solder on a single-sided PCB to form a slightly rounded mound. This
is because the solder does not flow down into the hole alongside the lead, but instead tends
to form a "puddle" on the PCB pad. You can reduce this (if it bothers you) by using some
additional flux and increasing the heat of the soldering iron.

With a double-sided (or multi-layer) PCB with plated-through holes in the pads, the solder
should flow through the hole and form a fillet, or sloped fill, on each side of the PCB.
The fillet will be largest on the side where the solder was applied and might not be visibly
obvious on the component side of the PCB, but the solder should still flow through and fill
the hole. <<pcb_solder_joint>> shows a diagram of what a PCB solder connection should look
like. Your results may vary, but the general idea is to have the solder flow through the
plated hole in the pad along the component lead.

[[pcb_solder_joint]]
.Through-hole solder joint for a double-sided PCB
image::images/pect_0430.png[width="350",align="center"]

[TIP]
====
Although some sources state that you should heat the pieces being soldered before applying the
solder, it helps if the tip of the soldering iron is "wetted" with some solder before it is
applied to the work. Without a good thermal connection, the work will take too long to heat up,
and that heat will be transferred into something that could be damaged. Practice will allow
you to experiment and see what works best for you, but I recommended using a wetted iron tip
and applying the solder to the point where the tip meets the parts being soldered. The solder
will melt and flow as soon as the tip and the work pieces reach an appropriate temperature.
====

When you are working with a PCB, and a single-sided PCB in particular, it helps if the PCB is clean--really clean. Wiping it down with 90% isopropyl alcohol will remove any residual oil
or other contaminants. It also helps if the component leads are clean. Lastly, applying paste
or liquid flux can make things go more smoothly, but it does leaves a mess that has to be
cleaned up when the soldering is complete. <<paste_flux>> shows a small container of paste
flux that can be applied with a wood toothpick or a thin stick made from a wood-handle cotton
swab (use the bare end, or just cut off the swab). I use the Puritan brand 6-inch wood shaft
swabs, which can be purchased online through Amazon in packs of 1,000 for about $15 or less.

[[paste_flux]]
.A small container of paste flux
image::images/pect_0431.png[width="300",align="center"]

After soldering, it is a good idea to go over the connections with a cleaning solution or just
with 90% isopropyl alcohol, particularly if additional flux was used. A small brush, called
an _acid brush_, is commonly used for this task. It is typically used to apply paste flux
compounds for soldering copper tubing and pipes, but it is also used in the electronics
industry for PCB cleaning applications. You can purchase acid brushes at electronics suppliers,
hardware stores, and plumbing supply stores. They are also available in packs of 6, 12, or
more from various online sources. I like to trim about 1/4 to 1/3 of an inch off the
end of the brush to make it stiffer.

It is a good idea to remove leftover flux from the PCB after you have finished soldering,
because flux can attract moisture and dirt. Also, if the humidity and temperature are just
right, leftever flux residue can conduct a weak current, which introduces
noise into a circuit and possibly cause erratic behavior.

[TIP]
====
Alcohol and other cleaning solvents tend to leave a white residue on a PCB if it isn't flushed
off completely. This is just flux residue that was deposited when the solvent evaporated. It
is a good idea to remove it, and one way to do that is to go over the board with a dry acid
brush. Another way is to wash the board in distilled water while brushing it. So long as there
are no parts, such as potentiometers or switches, that might have problems with trapped water it
won't hurt anything, and distilled water is nonconductive. Just make sure the board is
completely dry before you apply power.
====

===== Soldering Defects

If the solder is disturbed while still molten, it can disrupt the solder's internal
structure and create a rough-looking connection, or joint. Also, if the work is not hot
enough, the solder won't flow properly, and the result will be a joint that is weak and might
not conduct current reliably. This is called a cold solder joint, and an example is shown in <<cold_solder_joint>>.

[[cold_solder_joint]]
.Cold solder jointfootnote:[Photo by coronium, CC-BY-SA-3.0, http://bit.ly/cold-solder]
image::images/pect_0432.png[width="300",align="center"]

When applied correctly, the solder should flow (literally) across the work, leaving a smooth, shiny
joint. If the solder is applied quickly enough, the risk of thermal damage to components can be minimized. When
the surface of the solder is grainy or dull, it indicates that the component lead may have moved
before the solder cooled sufficiently, or the soldering iron wasn't hot enough. Although a cold
solder joint might look like it is solid, it really isn't, and can lead to a broken joint down
the road.

Although not as common as cold solder joints, broken solder joints can also occur. This happens
when the lead of a through-hole component breaks free of the surrounding solder on a pad
or terminal, often taking some of the original solder with it. This type of defect is typically
seen when a circuit board has been subjected to shock or vibration. It was once quite common in
portable electronics with single-sided PCBs but is less common with double-sided or multi-layer
PCBs and does not occur with surface-mounted components. A cold solder joint can be the
precursor to a broken solder joint.

This type of problem can be difficult to track down, as it might be intermittent.
<<broken_solder_joint>> shows what to look for on a PCB if you suspect that you might have a
broken solder joint.

[[broken_solder_joint]]
.Broken solder jointsfootnote:[Photo by coronium, CC-BY-SA-3.0, http://bit.ly/brokenjoints.]
image::images/pect_0433.png[width="300",align="center"]

To fix a cold solder joint or a broken joint, I recommend that you use some paste or liquid flux and apply a small amount of additional solder while reheating the joint. The flux will
help to remove any existing contamination and oxidation, and the new solder will help to
melt and reflow the original solder. <<broken_solder_joint>> illustrates an additional problem:
the pad on the right has lifted from the PCB (delaminated). Since the solder joint appears to
be solid, this can possibly be saved with the application of a small amount of epoxy. If this
is a double-sided PCB, the opposite side will likely need some rework, as well.

==== Desoldering Wires and Through-Hole Parts

There are basically two ways to remove solder and free a part: wicking and suction. Wicking
involves the use of a copper braid, called (as you might guess) _solder wick_. <<solder_wick>> shows a spool of solder
wick.

[[solder_wick]]
.Solder wick
image::images/pect_0434.png[width="300",align="center"]

The suction method involves a tool of some sort capable of pulling molten solder away from
a pad or terminal using a temporary vacuum. The tools available include a squeeze bulb, a
spring-loaded device called a _desoldering pump_ (known colloquially as a _solder sucker_), and
soldering repair and rework stations with built-in vacuum pumps. <<solder_sucker>> shows a
typical hand-operated desoldering pump (and, as usual with my tools, it's seen some use over
the years--but it still works just fine).

[[solder_sucker]]
.Typical desoldering pump
image::images/pect_0435.png[width="300",align="center"]

I don't consider the squeeze bulb to be of much use, so I won't discuss it here. If you
want to try it, by all means do so. The pass:[<span class="keep-together">technique</span>] is basically the same as that used
with a spring-loaded desoldering pump, but it's been my experience that the bulb is just
not as effective in terms of creating a quick vacuum to pull off the old solder. I'm also
not a big fan of most soldering rework stations with a built-in vacuum pump. The concept
is good, but often the execution leaves something to be desired. There are some good
rework stations on the market, but they tend to be really expensive. The wick and the solder
pump will work for almost every desoldering job that might come up, and they are cheap and
easy to find.

Solder wick is relatively easy to use, but it does take a bit of practice to get
it right each time. The first step is to make sure the solder joint is clean. Use
some isopropyl alcohol to remove any residual dirt or grease. Next, apply the
soldering iron and maybe a wee bit of solder to remelt the connection. Then, while
the joint is still hot, place the wick on it as shown in <<using_solder_wick>>. The
soldering iron is pressed down on top of the wick and the molten solder should flow
up into it. Sometimes it helps to apply a little bit of liquid or paste flux to help
get the solder flowing smoothly. This is what the gooey stuff around the pads happens
to be, and in this case it was liquid flux from a tube.

[[using_solder_wick]]

The spring-loaded desoldering pump has been around for a long time. The early types
didn't always work very well, but newer models have better seals on the internal
plunger and more durable tips. The tip is made from a high-temperature plastic, so
while it is possible to melt it, it takes some effort to do so.

To use the desoldering pump, first cock it by pushing down on the plunger until it locks.
Then simply heat the solder connection until the old solder melts, quickly place the
tip of the pump over the joint, and release the plunger. <<using_solder_sucker>> shows
a desoldering pump in action.

[[using_solder_sucker]]
.Using a desoldering pump
image::images/pect_0437.png[width="300",align="center"]

As with the solder wick, using a desoldering pump is not something you can expect to
master the first time (or second, or third). It take practice to develop a "feel" for
when the solder is the right temperature and the best angle to use for placing the
tip of the tool on the solder joint. In <<using_solder_sucker>>, the tip of the pump is
being held just above the pad while the iron melts the solder. It is then immediately
placed on the molten solder and the trigger is pressed to release the plunger. <<solder_sucker_result>> shows the result.

[[solder_sucker_result]]

In case you're wondering, the images in this section came about because a potentiometer was mounted
upside down on a PCB. It needed to be removed and reinstalled on the other side of the
board. The operation was a success and it works correctly now.

==== Surface-Mount Soldering

Soldering surface-mount technology components (or SMDs, surface-mount devices)
correctly and reliably by hand requires a considerable amount of practice and skill, but
it can be done for many types of SMT components. You will need the correct type of
soldering iron and tip, solder paste, a magnifier of some sort, tweezers, and a steady
hand. Chapters pass:[<a href="Chapter_8">8</a>] and pass:[<a href="Chapter_9">9</a>] describe SMT component packages.

The first step is to apply the paste where the component will attach to the PCB,
as shown in <<applying_solder_paste>>. It doesn't really take much paste to do the job,
but a little extra doesn't really hurt anything. It just makes things a bit messier and
makes more work for the clean-up step.

[[applying_solder_paste]]
.Applying solder paste
image::images/pect_0439.png[width="300",align="center"]

Next, position the part (in this case, a resistor) in the correct location, setting it on and slightly into the paste. The binder in the paste acts as a weak glue,
holding the part to the PCB, as shown in <<setting_part_on_paste>>.

[[setting_part_on_paste]]
.Setting a part on the solder paste
image::images/pect_0440.png[width="300",align="center"]

While holding the part down with the tweezers (or something similar), apply the tip of
the soldering iron to each end of the part. Be sure to touch the tip to both the part
and the underlying PCB so that they will both heat at the same time. The paste should
melt and flow onto and under the part, as shown in <<soldering_part_with_paste>>.

[[soldering_part_with_paste]]
.Soldering one end of an SMT resistor
image::images/pect_0441.png[width="300",align="center"]

When complete, the final result should look like <<soldered_smt_part>>. Your part might
have one end slightly raised, but that's all right for a manual soldering job. The main
objective is for the part to be securely soldered to the PCB with bright, shiny solder
joints.

[[soldered_smt_part]]
.Soldered surface-mount resistor
image::images/pect_0442.png[width="300",align="center"]

Soldering a surface-mount integrated circuit (IC) to a PCB is trickier than a single resistor. The first
step is to apply solder paste to all of the connection points on the PCB, as shown
in <<ic_paste_apply>>.

[[ic_paste_apply]]
.Applying solder paste for a surface-mount IC part
image::images/pect_0443.png[width="300",align="center"]

You want to apply just enough paste to make a good solder joint, but not so much that
the part "floats" on the paste. In other words, it should settle close to the PCB when
it is placed on the paste-covered pads, with little extra paste oozing out from under
the leads of the part.

The reason for the close initial fit is to avoid having to force down the leads of the IC to meet the underlying PCB during soldering. If this happens,
there is a definite possibility that they will spring back up when the soldering iron
tip is removed, undoing the soldering job and making for a situation where you might
spend considerable time trying to figure out why something works only intermittently.

To solder the IC, apply a fine-tip soldering iron to each lead of the IC, holding it
only long enough for the paste to melt and flow. In <<soldering_smt_ic>>, a tool made of
high-temperature plastic is being used to hold the part and keep it aligned on the PCB
pads. The first pin is now finished and the tip of the iron is being pulled away. This
will be repeated for each of the pin on the IC. Notice that another part has already
been soldered to the board. It looks nice because it was cleaned up after soldering
with alcohol and a brush.

[[soldering_smt_ic]]
.Soldering a surface-mount IC part
image::images/pect_0444.png[width="300",align="center"]

When the soldering is finished, you can use a razor knife with a fine tip to test each
lead for a solid connection. None of the leads should lift when pried gently with the
tip of the razor knife.

<<finished_smt_ic>> shows what a finished surface-mount IC should look like when it is
soldered to the PCB correctly. It might be necessary to clean up around the IC using a
brush and a cleaning solvent, as discussed in <<pcb_soldering>>.

[[finished_smt_ic]]
.Soldered surface-mount IC
image::images/pect_0445.png[width="300",align="center"]

The SMT workstation shown in <<smt_soldering_station>> has both a temperature-controlled soldering
iron and a hot-air attachment (there is a small pump inside the unit to provide a
constant flow of air). A surface-mount part can be soldered (and desoldered) with the
hot-air tool once it is set into the solder paste. This actually makes for cleaner
connections with less leftover residue to clean up, but it does require a somewhat
pricey workstation, and a fair amount of practice. <<hot-air_soldering>> shows the
hot-air tool with a tip mounted on the end. The tool comes with a selection of tips
with orifices of various diameters.

[[hot-air_soldering]]
.Hot-air tool for SMT soldering and desoldering
image::images/pect_0446.png[width="300",align="center"]

This tool can be used to solder an SMD IC to a PCB, provided that the temperature and air
flow are set correctly. It takes some practice and experience to be able to define just
what "correctly" means in each situation and with different models of SMT soldering
tools. The preliminary steps (cleaning the PCB and applying the solder paste) are the
same as before with the soldering iron.

When using a hot-air system, you should still hold the part down, mainly to prevent the
air flow from moving it once the solder starts to melt. Use metal tweezers or a
high-temperature tool made specifically for this purpose, like the one shown in
<<soldering_smt_ic>>.

When you are doing hot-air soldering, it is important not to use too much solder paste. Not only does this reduce the mess you will need to clean up afterward, but the less solder to be melted the better. The hot-air nozzle isn't as discriminating as a soldering
iron, so it is possible to heat not only the leads of the part, but the entire part as well.
If you do elect to purchase one of these tools, you should also be prepared to buy
a couple of tubes of solder paste and several surface-mount practice kits, and spend some
quality time with it.

There are some surface-mounted components that simply cannot be soldered by hand. These
include ball-grid array (BGA) parts or other package styles with connection points
underneath the body of the part. Some types of connectors and inductors are made like
this, and they can be difficult to solder manually as well. In these cases, you should
probably consider paying someone with an SMT reflow soldering system to mount the parts
for you. If this person has what is called a _pick-and-place_ machine available, he or she can
also populate and solder an entire circuit board automatically. The set-up costs for
such a process can be significant, however, so it might not be practical for a one-off
board. Still, most fabricators that deal with surface-mount production have people on
staff who can manually place the parts on one or two PCBs and then put them through
the reflow soldering machine.

Manual surface-mount soldering can be tedious, and it requires patience and a steady
hand. For some applications, it is unavoidable, particularly if the parts you want
to use come only in surface-mount packages. On the other hand, if you are building
a prototype or just a one-off where size isn't a big issue, then opt for the
through-hole or point-to-point soldering techniques, if possible.

==== Surface-Mount Desoldering

To be perfectly honest, without a hot-air tool like the workstation shown in Figures pass:[<a href="smt_soldering_station">3-44</a>] and pass:[<a href="hot-air_soldering">4-46</a>], desoldering any surface mount part with more than two connection
points can be a major challenge, if not nearly impossible. The reason for this is that a
SMD with multiple leads really needs to be desoldered all at once. Solder wick or a pump
can get some of the solder, but it is difficult to get at the solder under tiny gull-wing
or J leads. One technique involves heating and lifting each lead using a fine-tip razor
knife, a large pin (e.g., a hat pin), or needle-point tweezers. This is tedious, to say the
least, and with a J-lead part it can effectively ruin an otherwise reusable part. If the
part uses metalized connection points under the body of the part, then using a razor knife,
pin, tweezers, solder wick, or a pump is not a viable option.

<<hot-air_tool>> shows the hot-air attachment for an SMT soldering station in use as a
desoldering tool. You use the air flow to heat all of the part's leads at once by moving
it around the part in a tight circular motion while applying pressure under the part with
needle-point tweezers. There are also tools and attachments for the hot-air nozzle made
specifically for this purpose that are not shown here.

[[hot-air_tool]]
.Desoldering a surface-mount IC with hot air
image::images/pect_0447.png[width="300",align="center"]

Once the solder under all the leads has melted, the part can be lifted off and set aside
to cool. The PCB will probably need some cleanup with alcohol and
perhaps the removal of leftover solder with solder wick.

Provided that the part wasn't heated too severely, it might still be usable, although
excessive heat can stress the silicon chip inside the part and possibly cause some of
the ultra-fine wires that connect it to the outside leads on
the package to become unreliable. I keep a special parts bin just for "suspect" parts
that have been removed from a PCB. They might work, and they might not, but if I'm in
a hurry and willing to gamble, and component failure isn't a big deal, then I can dig
through the bin and see if there's something I can use.

=== Cutting

The term _cutting_ covers a lot of ground, ranging from dealing with things like
rod, bar, and sheet stock, to cutting something to modify it. There are techniques
for each situation, some better than others.

==== Rod and Bar Stock

Cutting small-dimension metal rod and bar stock, in the 1/8-inch to 1-inch range, is easily accomplished with a miniature cut-off tool like the one shown in <<cutoff_saw>> (also
described in <<Chapter_3>>). This type of tool is sometimes called a _saw_, but
it is actually a type of grinder. It is relatively inexpensive, and it produces a clean,
even cut through the material. The shield has been raised in <<cutoff_saw>>, so you can
see the cutting wheel and the clamp.

[[cutoff_saw]]
.Miniature cut-off saw in action
image::images/pect_0448.png[width="300",align="center"]

Notice that the miniature cut-off saw has a clamp built into its base. It is a good
idea to use it--always. If you have a saw like this without a clamp, it would
be wise to get one or improvise something. The reason is that, although it is small,
this saw can produce a lot of torque, and it can easily throw a loose work piece
across the room (or at you!). It can also remove fingers without too much effort,
so you really don't want your hand near the blade trying to hold something down
while you cut it.

There are different types of cutting wheels available for small cut-off saws. These
aren't really blades, but rather thin grinding wheels. The level of abrasiveness is
specified as the _grit_. A coarse grit, between 40 and 50, will cut heavier material,
but it won't make a really fine cut. A finer grit, about 60 or so, will make a smoother
cut, but it can overheat if used to cut thick material.

Some small cut-off tools are made to work with both blades and abrasive wheels, while
others, like the one in <<cutoff_saw>>, use an abrasive wheel only. Since this tool
is used only for cutting metal, there is no need for a toothed blade. There are other,
larger, tools available with 7.25-, 8-, or 10-inch-diameter toothed blades for cutting
non-metallic materials.

Alternatively, you can use a bench vise and a hacksaw, as shown in <<using_hacksaw>>.
The secret to a clean cut is to make sure that the material is firmly clamped, the
saw blade is sharp, and you have applied some form of lubrication. Trying to cut
something by holding it down by hand on the bench might work with soft plastics, but
it doesn't always work so well with metal. The hacksaw blade will tend to bind, bounce,
and "chatter" on hard materials, resulting in a rough cut that might require additional
work (grinding and sanding) to make it usable.

[[using_hacksaw]]
.Cutting with a hacksaw
image::images/pect_0449.png[width="300",align="center"]

Move the blade of the hacksaw through the material with even strokes, and use the entire
length of the blade. Let the teeth on the blade do most of the work for you. If cutting
metal, go slowly--no more than about one stroke per second. The saw blade can get quite
hot, even with a lubricant, and excessive heat can ruin the blade. The saw blades of the
impatient have many dull and flattened teeth.

For a typical hacksaw blade, the cutting action occurs only on either the push or pull
stroke, depending on how the blade was mounted in the hacksaw frame. I prefer to have
it cut on the inward stroke (i.e., when pulling the saw toward you), somewhat like a
Japanese woodworking saw. You might want to try it both ways and see which is best for
you. <<hacksaw_parts>> shows the common names for the various parts of a typical
hacksaw. Note that this type differs from the one shown in <<mini_hacksaw>>, which is
a more compact version.

[[hacksaw_parts]]
[role="float-top wide"]
.Parts of a typical hacksaw
image::images/pect_0450.png[align="center"]

Hacksaws like the one shown in <<hacksaw_parts>> have a sliding section of the frame
that allows for different length hacksaw blades. The slide usually has two or three
stop positions. In the US, blades are readily available in 10-inch (250 millimeter) and 12-inch
(300 millimeter) lengths. The number of teeth per inch (or centimeter) is another specification, and
you can get blades with 14, 18, 24, and 32 teeth per inch (TPI). The coarse blades
are good for cutting thick metal, while the finer pitches are useful for making finer
cuts and working with thin materials.

Using a lubricant when cutting metal with a hacksaw is always a good idea. A light
oil works well. <<drilling_lubricants>> lists lubricants for drilling, but these can also
be applied to cutting with a hacksaw. The only exception might be the use of alcohol with
aluminum. In that situation, I would recommend mineral oil or some other light oil. I like
to use a bottle of oil with an extendable spout tube.

Lastly, make sure the blade is correctly tensioned in the saw frame. There is usually a
wing nut at one end for this purpose. A loose blade might bind or create a ragged cut, so
the blade tension should be tight, but not too tight. It is tight enough when the wing nut
becomes too tight to easily turn by hand. Don't use a tool to make it tighter, as this
could cause the blade to break or damage the frame.

==== Sheet Stock

You can cut material such as sheet plastic with a pair of heavy-duty shop
shears like the tool shown in <<shop_shears>>. These are useful for cutting thin
material such as sheet brass or copper, soft plastics, and wire mesh.

[[shop_shears]]
.Heavy-duty shop shears (straight cut)
image::images/pect_0451.png[width="400",align="center"]

Generally speaking, plastic sheet, such as the polystyrene in <<heavy_shears>>,
is easy to cut, so long as it is not too thick. The shears will split the material
and lift one side up along one of the blades, but thick material will not lift
as easily, and the shears could bind. If the plastic sheet is too thick for the
shears to deal with, then it's time to consider another approach, such as the
rotary tool (see <<rotary_tool_use>>), or the bench shear shown in <<bench_shear>>.

[[heavy_shears]]
.Using shop shears on sheet plastic
image::images/pect_0452.png[width="400",align="center"]

Sheet metal, unless it is very thin, can be a real pain to cut, even with special-purpose, aircraft-type sheet-metal cutters like those shown in <<metal_shears>>.
These are also known as _snips_ in some circles. These tools come in three forms:
left, right, and center. Each type is designed to cut a curve in a particular
direction (or no curve at all).

[[metal_shears]]
.Aircraft-type metal shear (aviation snip)
image::images/pect_0453.png[width="400",align="center"]

Because metal is a stiff material, some effort might be required to make the cut. As
with the shop shears shown in <<shop_shears>>, the metal shears will push up one side of the
material as it is cut. It is easier to cut off a small section of the metal sheet,
around 1/4-inch wide, and work into the desired depth in a series of shallow cuts.
Trying to cut directly through a sheet of aluminum or thin steel from a starting
position several inches into the material might be difficult, depending on the thickness
of the material. In <<cutting_metal>>, the cut was started deeper into the sheet
because it was thin. If it had been thicker, it would have been easier to make
a series of shallower cuts to get to the desired width.

[[cutting_metal]]
.Using aircraft-style metal shears
image::images/pect_0454.png[width="400",align="center"]

Hand-held shears, or nippers, are handy for quick jobs or trimming something to make it fit, but the best
solution for cutting both plastic and metal sheet stock is a bench shear, like the one
shown in <<bench_shear>>. If you can justify purchasing one, then by all means do
so. A good bench shear can save a lot of time and give the end result a professional
appearance. This particular tool can also serve as a brake, which is useful for
bending sheet metal into complex shapes.

[[bench_shear]]
.Small bench shear/brake tool
image::images/pect_0455.png[width="300",align="center"]

A nibbler-type tool is yet another way to cut sheet metal. These tools come in
manual, electric, and pneumatic forms. <<nibbler>> shows a manual nibbler tool.

[[nibbler]]
.Manual nibbler tool
image::images/pect_0456.png[width="300",align="center"]

A nibbler works by literally nibbling away the material, one small bite at a time.
For thin materials and short cuts, this tool can do a decent job, but for anything
more substantial, you might want to consider using an electric or pneumatic-type nibbler
tool. A manual nibbler tends to be hard on the hand after just a short time. You
should also be prepared to clean up the cut with a file or a grinding attachment on
a rotary tool. Nibblers don't always make clean, even cuts, but with some
practice, they can do a decent job.

Last, but not least, is the rotary tool. For short cuts in thin material, it can
do an acceptable job. Refer to <<rotary_tool_use>> for suggestions and examples
of ways to get better control of a rotary tool and produce clean cuts. If you need
a long, straight cut (6-inch or more), then you really need a bench shear like the one
shown in <<bench_shear>>. The alternative is to make the best cut possible with
the appropriate tool and then clean it up with a file, a grinder, or a bench-mounted
belt sander.

=== Drilling

There's more to making a good hole than just eyeballing a drill bit and grabbing
the power drill. By "good hole," I mean one that will fit the part correctly, be it
a screw, a bolt, an LED, a switch, or anything else that needs to go through a
hole. If the hole is too small, it will need to be drilled again, which is
not a disaster, but can be an annoyance. If the hole is too large, the part will
simply fall through it, and there are not many options available to recover from
this kind of pass:[<span class="keep-together">mistake</span>].

.Fractions and Decimals
**************************
You might notice that many of the dimensions and drill sizes in this chapter, and
in fact throughout this book, are given in decimal inches, not fractions. There
are a couple of reasons for this. First, when you're selecting a drill bit for a tap hole, there usually just isn't a fractional drill size that will work
as intended. Instead, we need to switch to the drill index system and select a
drill bit on the basis of its decimal size. Second, when you're adding or subtracting
dimensional values, the decimal representation is a lot more convenient than
working with fractions.

Fractions do, however, get a lot of use in a typical machine shop. If you look at
a standard drill size table, you might notice that the index numbers act as intermediate
steps between the primary fractional dimensions. The fractional values increase in
increments of 1/64 (or 0.0156): 1/32 is 2/64, 3/32 is 6/64, and so on. If you don't
have a drill size table tacked up somewhere, you really should consider doing
so.

A typical drill set from the hardware store or your local home improvement center
will usually contain a selection of common drill sizes, from perhaps 1/16 inch up to 5/8 inch.
What it won't contain are the drill sizes listed in <<inch_tap_sizes>>. These are
index sizes, and there are no fractional equivalents. If you plan on doing a lot of
tapping, you'll need to also consider assembling a collection of index drills
specifically for tapping, or purchasing a large drill bit set with both the
standard fractional sizes and the index sizes.
**************************

[[selecting_a_drill_size]]
==== Selecting A Drill Size

The appropriate size (diameter) of a drill bit depends on what you want to use
the hole for. If you want a clearance hole (where something passes
through it without interference), the bit needs to be slightly larger than the
parts you want to use. If, on the other hand, you intend to tap the hole so
that it will accept a threaded part, it needs to be sized correctly to
allow for the tap to cut threads inside the hole to the correct depth.

For example, a clearance hole for a 6-32 machine screw would need to be no larger
than 0.1495 inch, which is a #25 drill. If the hole will be tapped to hold a 6-32
screw, then it should be 0.1160 or 0.1065 inch in diameter, depending on the depth
of the thread cut you want.

[NOTE]
====
The tap drill sizes shown here are for both 50% and 75% taps. A 50% tap means
that the threads will engage to 50% of their depth. This is usually more than
enough for most uses, and because the tap tool doesn't cut as deeply, there is
less risk that it will bind and break off in the hole during tapping. For very shallow
holes, you might want to consider using a 75% tap. These are harder to create,
but they will hold the fastener more securely when only a few thread turns are
engaged. Also be aware that some drill and tap size tables give the 75% drill
size, not the 50% size.
====

<<inch_tap_sizes>> shows a basic tap drill size chart for UTS/ANSI sizes.
The drill index refers to the standard numbering system used for drill bits.
Note that there are no fractional equivalents for these drill sizes.

|=========================================================

<<inch_clearance_sizes>> shows UTS/ANSI clearance drill sizes. These
are mainly recommendations, but they are used throughout industry. If you
don't have access to the specified index drills, choose a fractional
drill size that is large enough to allow the screw or bolt to slide through
but not so large that the head of the fastener falls through as well. The
index sizes listed will produce what is called a _free-fit hole_ (i.e., it
will be somewhat loose). Most of the fractional sizes listed are closer to
the tight clearances for each screw size. In the case of the 6-32 screw, there
is no fractional size drill that is close, so a 9/64 drill might create a hole
that is a little too tight, and the 5/32 might be too loose. Start with the
9/64 and see if it works for you. You can always make a hole larger with a
file or a reamer, but you can never make a hole smaller.

==== Drilling Speed

The appropriate rotational speed of a drill bit depends on the size of the
drill, the type of drill, and what it is cutting.

For example, for a standard twist drill (the most common type) used in a
drill press with aluminum or steel, the nominal speed varies from 3,000 RPM
for a small (1/16 inch) drill down to 600 RPM for a 5/8-inch drill cutting steel. In
general, the larger the drill, the slower the speed. <<drill_press_speeds>>
shows suggested speeds for various drill sizes and materials.

[[drill_press_speeds]]
.Recommended drill-press speeds
[width="100%",cols="<1,<1,<1,<1",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|============================================================
|Drill size   |Acrylic|Aluminum|Steel
|1/16 &#8211; 3/16 |2,500   |3,000    |3,000
|1/4 &#8211; 3/8   |2,000   |2,500    |1,000
|7/16 &#8211; 5/8  |1,500   |1,500    |600
|============================================================

Controlling drill speed with a hand-held variable speed power drill is
difficult, at best. Most hand-held cordless drills top out at around 1,500 RPM,
while corded drills can reach 2,500 RPM. When drilling a small-diameter hole
with a hand-held drill, you typically want to run the drill as fast as it will
go and keep the drill bit well lubricated.

==== Drilling Thin Sheet Stock

When drilling holes in thin sheet stock (like the cover panels on some types of
electronics enclosures) you should use a drill press, and the panel to be drilled
should be sandwiched in between two sheets of heavier material, like thicker
aluminum sheet or 1/2-inch-thick pieces of hardwood. Clamp it all down securely using
C clamps. <<thin_sheet_drill>> shows the concept behind this technique.

The benefits of this technique are that the hole will be cleaner (less jagged fringes)
and the sheet metal won't be distorted by the pressure of the drill bit. You can also
use just a bottom support to help reduce distortion. The downside with both approaches
is that you will have to sacrifice a piece or two of material to your drill press. I
recommend keeping a box of scraps near the drill press and just continue reusing
them until they are too full of holes to keep around any longer.

[[thin_sheet_drill]]
.Drilling thin sheet metal between sacrificial panels
image::images/pect_0457.png[width="400",align="center"]

If this sounds like a lot of work just to drill a hole, well, it is. But even if the hole
will be filled and covered by something like a switch or a knob, thin sheet metal can
still distort a significant distance outward. The ideal solution is not to use thin
sheet metal panels, but there may be times when that just can't be avoided.

==== Lubricants

If you are cutting through hard metal, such as steel or tempered aluminum, a lubricant
is a very good idea. Overheating a drill bit is a sure way to ruin it.

Some drill presses found in machine shops have a built-in lubricant pump and reservoir
tank, but for the rest of us, a can of machinist's lubricant will do. If you are using
a drill press and the work piece is clamped securely, you can apply the fluid yourself;
otherwise, you'll need an assistant to help with the lubricant while you hold the drill.

You can pick up a can of tapping or cutting fluid at any well-stocked hardware or home
improvement store, or even purchase some online. WD-40 also works well as a drilling
lubricant, as does kerosene or rubbing alcohol when you're working with aluminum. 

Just remember to continuously apply it to prevent overheating due to excessive friction. 

A large syringe is sometimes useful in this case, as is a 1/2-inch or 1-inch-width brush along with a
small metal can to hold the lubricant. In the past, it was common to find a cut-off soup
can sitting next to a machine tool with kerosene or cutting oil in it and a small brush
resting in the fluid.

Always check to make sure the cutting oil or lubricant you want to use is compatible
with the material to be drilled. 

<<drilling_lubricants>> lists some drilling lubricant
possibilities for different types of materials.

[[drilling_lubricants]]
.Drilling lubricant suggestions
[width="100%",cols="<1,<3",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|============================================================
|Material | Suggested lubricant/cutting fluid
|Aluminum | Kerosene
|         | Isopropyl alcohol
|         | Mineral oil
|Copper   | WD-40
|         | Light machine oil (sewing machine or turbine oil)
|         | Mineral oil
|Brass    | WD-40
|         | Light machine oil
|         | Mineral oil
|Iron     | SAE 10 or SAE 20 oil
|         | Light machine oil (with flow)
|         | Purpose-made cutting fluid
|Steel    | SAE 10 or SAE 20 oil
|         | Light machine oil (with flow)
|         | Purpose-made cutting fluid
|============================================================

The SAE 10 and SAE 20 grade oils should be nondetergent motor oil. Do not use standard
motor oil as a cutting oil, as it contains detergents and other agents. Also avoid the
multi-viscosity oils (i.e., the 10W-40 type).

When <<drilling_lubricants>> states "with flow," it means that the lubricant should
be constantly flowing over the drill as it cuts into the material. The flow rate for
something like the light machine oil doesn't need to be heavy, but drilling through iron
or steel can generate a lot of heat, so using a brush might not be sufficient. Softer
materials (such as aluminum, copper, and brass) are easier to drill without creating a lot
of friction heat, so long as they are lubricated.

In general, lighter lubricants need to flow constantly when used with hard materials,
and the lighter the lubricant, the more that needs to flow. This helps to prevent the
build-up of heat (which is the main purpose of the lubricant), and lighter fluids will
tend to burn off or evaporate faster than heavier lubricants. In any case, don't let
the drill bit run dry, or you could end up with a dull or ruined bit.

Some machine tools use water-based cutting lubricants (called _emulsified coolants_) that
flow constantly from a nozzle on a flexible tube that can be aimed at the tool. Other
machines, like large multi-axis computer-controlled tools, operate inside an enclosure
in a constant spray of coolant. For most tasks in a small shop, a brush or wash bottle
and a selection of easy-to-obtain lubricants is usually fine.

Most of us don't have fancy machine tools with built-in lubricaton systems, but from the
preceding discussion and <<drilling_lubricants>>, you can see that sometimes just drilling
a hole with a standard drill press can use a lot of lubricant. The question then arises:
where does all that lubricant go? I use an old rectangular cake pan for my miniature drill
press; the entire tool is small enough to sit in it. For the other
tools that don't need massive amounts of oil or kerosene, I use paper towels and place
them where they will catch the drips. The large drill press uses a plastic tub that sits
on the floor under the work table of the press. Some tools, such as manually operated
vertical mills and lathes, have catch basins built into the frame of the machine for
just this purpose.

If you are interested in the technical details of the effects of lubricants, and cutting
fluids in particular, a http://bit.ly/fluid-prop[paper from Michigan Technical University] discusses the effects of cutting fluids on heat transfer.

==== Punches and Pilot Holes

When you are drilling metal, it is a good idea to start with a punch point. This reduces
the chance of the drill bit "walking" away across the surface of the material by giving
it an indentation to settle into. The automatic punch described in <<specialty_tools>> is an
ideal tool for this. A center punch and a ball-peen hammer also works to create a starting
point for drilling.

When you are drilling large holes, a pilot hole is a good way to align a larger drill. Typically
you would want your pilot hole to be about 1/4 to 1/3 the diameter of the drill to be
used to make the final larger hole. This provides enough of a hole for the larger drill
to seat into. When you're using a hand-held drill, if the pilot hole is too small, the larger
bit can jump out and go for a walk across the surface of the material. If you are
drilling a very large hole, then you may need to create a sequence of progressively
larger pilot holes.

==== Using a Step Drill

Using a step drill, like the ones shown in <<specialty_tools>>, correctly is an incremental
process. This is particularly true when you're drilling into metal. The first step is to create
a pilot hole large enough to accommodate the smallest step on the drill bit. Then, using
generous amounts of lubricant, work each step of the drill bit into the material with a
pause in between to allow the bit to cool.

Using a step drill bit in a hand-held drill is somewhat problematic, depending on the
material you are drilling into, as a step drill might have a tendency to bind and good
control of the drill is necessary to prevent this. If you do elect to use a step drill
bit in a hand-held drill, make sure to maintain a tight grip on the drill at all
times and don't plunge the bit. Let the bit do the work for you as much as possible.

==== Common Drilling Problems

Drilling a hole sounds like a simple thing, and for the most part it is. But there are
some traps for the unwary even with something this simple. The biggest things to watch
out for are overheating, chatter, binding, and walking. Most of what is discussed in the
following sections applies to drilling metal. Wood and plastic have their own set of
similar issues, but metal is the most pass:[<span class="keep-together">challenging</span>].

===== Overheating

Attempting to drill through hard material like steel can result in a lot of friction.
This, in turn, creates a lot of heat. In some cases, the resulting heat can damage the
material being drilled, and it can definitely ruin an otherwise good drill bit. If you
don't have any lubricant handy, then try to make the hole in small increments, rather
than have at it all in one go. When drilling multiple holes in thin sheet steel, pause
between each hole to allow the drill bit to cool off.

===== Chatter

Chatter is a serious problem with a hand-held drill, but not so much with a drill press. Chatter can occur when you attempt to drill a large hole without
first drilling a pilot hole. For holes larger than about 1/8 inch in diameter, always drill
a small pilot hole first. If, for example, you are trying to drill a 1/2-inch hole in a
piece of 1/8-inch-thick tempered aluminum plate, start with a 1/8-inch drill, then go to a 1/4-inch,
followed by a 3/8-inch drill, and then use the 1/2-inch drill as the last step. As the bit gets
larger, the drill will be harder to control, so large holes are best done on a drill
press, if at all possible.

===== Binding

A close relative of chatter, binding can occur when you're drilling a large hole
and the bit attempts to take out more material than the drill motor can handle. On a
drill press, this can stall the spindle and cause the drive belt to slip. It is
particularly dangerous with a hand-held drill, because when the bit binds, it can rip
the drill out of your hands and break fingers. Use the same step-up technique as
described for chatter to help reduce the chance of a bind and possible injury.

===== Walking

A spinning drill bit will have a tendency to move across a surface unless there is a
starting dimple (via a punch) or a pilot hole to help keep it in place. This is called
_walking_, and with a hand-held drill it can result in a marred surface.

===== Dull Drill Bits

It seems that people (myself included) are constantly buying new drill bits to replace those that have
become dull and useless. When a drill bit becomes dull, it will no
longer cut correctly and will instead just spin and get extremely hot. Even bits used
just for wood will dull over time. This is more of a problem with hard woods, although
soft woods also take a toll. Composite materials like MDF (medium-density fiberboard),
MDO (medium-density overlay), and Masonite can also wear down a drill bit. The materials
used for printed circuit boards tend to be hard on drill bits, which is why PCB
fabricators will replace their drill bits on a regular basis.

When you're working with metal, the first line of defense against dulling is to use lubricant.
For woods and other materials, there isn't too much you can do about it, except to
occasionally sharpen dull bits and try to avoid overheating. In the past, a
drill bit was sharpened with a file and a vise, and the process was tedious and time consuming. It
also took a fair amount of practice to get it right. Another method uses a large bench
or stand grinder, possibly with a fixture to hold the drill bit to the grinding wheel
at the correct angle. Doing this by hand is possible, but not recommended.

There are different types of drill-bit sharpeners available, some better than others.
This is an area where you definitely get what you pay for, as the cheap drill-bit
sharpeners are better at leaving a drill bit in worse shape than they are at actually
sharpening a bit correctly. If you find yourself hunting through a collection of drill
bits for one that is still sharp, or purchasing new bits on a regular basis, then you
may want to consider buying a good sharpener.

Here are a few tips to avoid dulling drill bits:

 - Do not overheat the bit. Cut a little, back off a little, then cut some more. Don't try to plunge
all the way through thick material in one go. If the bit starts to smoke, it's definitely too hot.
 - When drilling through metal, use a lubricant or a cutting oil. Use more lubricant for
harder metals such as iron, steel, and tempered aerospace-grade pass:[<span class="keep-together">aluminum</span>].
 - Keep your drill bits clean. Leftover bits of metal and wood (and wood sap) can act as
abrasives and wear down the cutting edges of the bit.
 - Use the appropriate drill speed for the material. <<drill_press_speeds>> lists some
suggested speeds for various drill sizes and pass:[<span class="keep-together">materials</span>].

[[taps_and_dies_ch04]]
==== Taps and Dies

If you are using screws or bolts with matching nuts or prethreaded holes, you don't
need to worry about tapping a hole to create an internal thread. But if you need to
attach something like a bracket to a heavy piece of material and there is no easy way
to get behind the hole to attach a nut, then tapping the hole is a viable approach.

[NOTE]
====
When you are drilling a hole to be tapped, it is essential to select the appropriate
drill bit, as discussed in <<selecting_a_drill_size>>. If the hole diameter
is too small, the tap might bind and break off in the hole, and it is extremely
difficult to remove a broken tap. Conversely, if the hole diameter is too
large, the threads will not be deep enough to reliably grip the screw or
bolt, and it might pull out under stress.
====

Tapping a hole is fairly straightforward. Once a hole of the correct size has
been pass:[<span class="keep-together">drilled</span>], the appropriate tap tool is screwed into the hole with the tap
handle provided with the tap and die kit. If you drilled for a 50% hole, then
the tool should go in without too much resistance. A 75% hole will require
more force, since it is cutting through more material to create the threads
inside the hole.

Use plenty of lubricant when tapping threads. Never try to tap a hole if the
tool is dry. Even with a 50% hole, there's a small chance the tool might bind if
there is no lubricant, and once that happens, there is a distinct risk that you
might break the tap tool off in the hole while trying to extract it. A broken
tap is extremely difficult to extract. In some cases, it's better to make a
new hole and simply grind the broken tool flush with the surrounding surface.

As an example, let's look at the process of creating a tapped hole for a 6-32 machine
screw. <<tap_drill_1>> shows the piece of aluminum to be used, along with an
automatic punch immediately after the drill point mark is created. <<tap_drill_2>>
shows the work piece clamped to the table of the drill press, and a #34 drill
bit is being used to drill the hold. I elected to use a #34 drill bit instead
of a #32 (50%) or a #36 (75%), mainly because I didn't have a #32 handy. The
result will be somewhere between a 50% and 75% tap cut.

In <<tap_drill_3>>, the hole is drilled, and tapping can commence. Note that I used
a thin lubricant during drilling--rubbing alcohol (isopropyl), in this case. In
<<tap_drill_4>>, the work piece has been moved away from the drill chuck with the
clamps still in place (the work table of most drill presses can swivel on the main
post of the press) and the tap has been mounted in the tap handle. This special
tool usually comes with a tap and die kit, but can also be purchased separately
(as this one was).

image::images/pect_0463.png[width="300",align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
Make sure the axis of the tap stays aligned with the hole, and always try to make the
tap vertically. Trying to tap a hole at an angle can bind the tool and cause it to
break, and once the alignment is lost, it's very difficult to correct it using a hand-tapping tool. This is one of reasons that machine shops use tapping fixtures, as
described next. In <<tap_drill_5>>, the tap appears to be nonvertical relative to
the work piece, but it really is lined up vertically; it's the image that isn't vertical.
====

If you find yourself doing a lot of tapping, you might want to invest in a bench-top
tapping fixture made specifically to hold the tap in constant alignment. <<tapping_fixture>>
shows a diagram of typical tool of this type. It is also possible to use the chuck of a
lathe or drill press to align and hold a tap while you turn the chuck manually (power is
off). There are also how-to videos and articles online that describe how to build your own
hand-tapping fixture. The whole idea is to keep the tap in alignment with the hole.

[[tapping_fixture]]
.A bench-mounted tapping fixture
image::images/pect_0464.png[width="300",align="center"]

The fixture in <<tapping_fixture>> uses the weight of the spindle assembly to apply
a small amount of downward force to the tap, and the cutting threads of the tap itself will
pull it into the work piece. It might take a small amount of pressure to get the tap
started, but for the most part, all you need to do is turn the spindle using
the handles. A hole in the table at the base of the fixture allows the tap to pass
completely through the work piece, and there is usually some kind of clamp arrangement
or perhaps a small vise (not shown here) to hold the work piece securely.

There are automated and semi-automated power-tapping tools available. These turn up
mostly in machine shops and on assembly lines. Some people have also built their own
power-tapping machines using cordless drills and screwdrivers. But for these tools to
work correctly and reliably, everything has to be just right. The hole has to be exactly
the right size and depth, and the work piece has to be held in exactly the right place.
Lastly, the tool needs to be able to stop at the correct depth, reverse the tap rotation,
and then back it out of the work piece. Commercial versions of these tools aren't cheap,
so for most of us, it comes down to doing it the hard way by hand.

The counterpart of the tap is the die, and if you need a threaded rod that cannot be
purchased at the hardware store, then this is the tool to reach for. For example,
consider the situation in <<threaded_rod>>. Here we have a steel rod with some threads
at each end. This might be used as part of a linear position sensor (as described in
<<Chapter_8>> in the discussion of linear potentiometers), or perhaps it is a tie rod
for the steering on a robot. While you could find a steel rod with full end-to-end
threading, that might not be what you really want. With a die, you can make a rod like
the one in <<threaded_rod>> to meet your requirements.

[[threaded_rod]]
.Steel rod with threaded ends
image::images/pect_0465.png[width="500",align="center"]

Using a die is relatively straightforward, but be forewarned that getting good results
when cutting threads by hand is not easy. It takes practice and a fair amount of patience
to get it right. In other words, it can be a real challenge.

<<typical_die>> shows a die for cutting 10-24 threads along with the holder it mounts
into. Some people suggest grinding a slight taper into the end of the rod to allow it
to feed into the die more easily, and I would agree with this. It's very difficult to
convince a die to start to "bite" into a rod without a taper at the end.

[[typical_die]]
.A small die with a holder
image::images/pect_0466.png[width="300",align="center"]

When you look closely at a die, you will see that the cutting teeth have a "lead-in"
chamfer on one side. This is the side you start with on the rod to be threaded. This
allows the tool to gradually work into the rod. The taper on the rod helps as well.
You can see the taper in <<using_a_die>>. Make sure you mount the die in the holder
with the entry side facing out, which is down in this case (the holder has a lip to hold
the die; this is the exit side). If you try to use the holder with the die in backward,
the force you might need to exert to start the cut will cause it to pop out of the holder.

[[using_a_die]]
.Completed thread cut with a 10-24 die
image::images/pect_0467.png[width="300",align="center"]

The die can exert a lot of force on the rod, so it needs to be firmly clamped vertically
in a vise of some sort, as shown in <<using_a_die>>. It is not possible to reliably hold
the work piece in your hand and cut threads into it with a die. As with tapping, be sure
to use a lubricant to reduce friction and prevent binding. I used a light oil for the
lubricant in this case. <<finished_rod>> shows the finished rod with about 1 inch of threads
cut into one end. A 10-24 nut has been threaded onto the rod as a check.

It is essential to always use a rod of the correct diameter for the threads you are
trying to cut. Cutting an oversize rod with a die can result in the die becoming jammed
onto the rod. If this happens, you might end up having to cut off the end of the rod, along
with the jammed die, and then throwing it away. Forcing an oversized rod through a die
can also dull or damage the die. Conversely, if the rod diameter is too small, the die's
teeth won't cut deep enough threads and the threaded part probably won't work correctly
with a standard size threaded hole or nut.

Screws and bolts have two basic measurements that define the diameter of a part. The
first is the thread diameter (or _major diameter_). This is the diameter of the outside of
the threads on the part. The second is the root diameter (or _minor diameter_), which is
the diameter of the part across the bottoms (valleys) of the threads.

In general, for UTS/ANSI threads, the thread (major) diameter of a particular gauge less
about 0.005 inch works well as a rod diameter. <<uts_machine_screw_sizes>>
lists the thread diameters for common machine screws. Some
tool manufacturers may offer diameter suggestions that are slightly different than the
standard for a particular screw or bolt diameter, but the differences aren't very much.

The dies found in an inexpensive kit are typically fixed in terms of the diameter of
rod they will work with. Professional (and more expensive) tools have adjustments that
allow the die to be sized. With these types of tools, one approach is to start off with
the die opened up, and then bring it in to the final thread diameter over the course
of multiple passes on the rod.

As stated earlier, cutting threads by hand with a die can be a major challenge. Perhaps
the most challenging part is the amount of force needed to start the die while trying
to keep it aligned at the same time. With a rod that has a diameter equivalent to the
nut or threaded hole it will mate with, it can be really hard. Unless the part I'm
making needs to be able to withstand significant stress, I typically use a rod with a
diameter slightly less than what is listed in <<uts_machine_screw_sizes>>, just to make it
easier on myself. If you find yourself cutting a lot of threads by hand, you may want to
investigate the use of a small lathe or a special-purpose thread-cutting tool.

[NOTE]
====
With both tap and die cutting, a general rule of thumb is that as the size
(diameter) of the tap or die gets smaller, the harder it becomes to avoid breaking
a tap, jamming a die, or twisting off the end of a rod with a die. Small-diameter
screws and bolts typically have more threads per inch (or millimeter) than larger fasteners,
and the threads are much finer. The result is that the tolerances are tighter and
the chances for friction and binding much higher.
====

This section is just a cursory overview of the techniques used with taps and dies.
This is an old subject, so there is a huge body of literature available. If you want
to learn more, I would suggest investing in a machine shop reference book or two, such
as _Machinery's Handbook_ (see <<Appendix_D>>). Even older books (from the middle of
the last century, for instance) have valuable information, and I've found some real
gems on the bookshelves at thrift stores. Taps, dies, and drills haven't changed
much in the past 100 years, and neither have the techniques for using
them.

=== Modification Cutting

Sometimes, you might need to cut something to modify it. For example, let's say you want
to modify a device to install a new module or component, but it won't fit unless there's
a new hole for it to fit into. This is a case of hacking in the truest sense, and there are
several ways to do it.

==== Jeweler's Saw

A jeweler's saw (introduced in <<small_hand_saws>>) is designed to make small, precise cuts
to create intricate patterns. Unlike a hacksaw, a jeweler's saw uses a very narrow
blade, which can be turned easily while cutting. A coping saw is similar to a jeweler's
saw but is used primarily in woodworking to create intricate patterns. <<using_jewelers_saw>>
shows a typical jeweler's saw in action.

[[using_jewelers_saw]]
.Using a jeweler's saw
image::images/pect_0469.png[width="300",align="center"]

Using a jeweler's saw takes a bit of practice. I recommend using guidelines, like the ones
shown in <<using_jewelers_saw>>. The material is a piece of thin MDO (medium-density overlay, a
type of plywood), but it could just as easily have been plastic or even thin sheet metal.
The guidelines were made with a mechanical pencil. If you are cutting metal, you will
probably want to use a fine-tip permanent marker (which comes off with rubbing alcohol,
by the way).

The most common mistake is to apply too much force while trying to move the saw through the
material to be cut. This usually results in a snapped blade. Let the saw do its job, and
apply only enough pressure to keep it firmly in contact with the material. When turning a
corner with a jeweler's saw, move slowly and cut in short, even strokes. The objective
is to avoid binding the blade in the turn while still staying on the guideline. Be patient;
these little saws can do a good job, but they don't do it very fast.

Note that the jeweler's saw is being held with two hands in <<using_jewelers_saw>>. One hand provides the
cutting force, while the other steadies the saw and guides it. While it is possible to
operate a small saw like this one-handed, I don't recommend it. It's easy for the saw
to "get away" from you and head off in a direction you don't want it to go. Using two
hands prevents this. You also need two hands to navigate corners.

I should also point out that the cut was started from the hole drilled to the inside of
the circle on the right. The blade was removed from the far end of the saw frame, inserted
through the hole, and then clamped back into the blade holder and retensioned. The near
end of the blade (closest to the handle) was not removed. If you don't want to have an
entry cut coming in from the side of the piece you are cutting, there really isn't any
other way to do this. The blade is flexible and easy to remount once it is through
the starting hole.

[[rotary_tool_use]]
==== Rotary Tool

Modifying things is where a rotary tool really shines. <<rotary_cutoff>> shows a rotary
tool with a cut-off disc attached. The cut-off disc is basically just a thin wafer of
abrasive material made with a binding adhesive and formed under pressure, so it will wear
down with use. If you are doing a lot of this type of cutting (or plan to), you might
want to consider buying the cut-off discs in bulk packs.

[[rotary_cutoff]]
.Rotary tool cut-off disc

It is a good idea to cut to the inside of the final dimensions of the hole, because
holding a rotary tool steady while cutting can be a challenge. The edges of the hole can
be finished out to the desired dimensions with a razor knife and a file, but a hole that
is too large cannot be easily fixed.

You might find it difficult to hold the rotary tool steady while cutting a straight
line. Here's a trick to help with that: clamp the rotary tool down to the workbench, not
the work piece you are cutting. A small bench vise, with some padding if necessary, works
well for this, as shown in <<rotary_in_vise>>.

[[rotary_in_vise]]
.Rotary tool in a bench vise
image::images/pect_0471.png[width="300",align="center"]

Mounting the rotary tool in a vise allows you to move the piece you are cutting under the
cutting wheel while the rotary tool is held firmly. The piece you are cutting is probably
going to be much lighter and easier to maneuver than the tool. You can use something like
a block of wood to brace your hand, or even support the work piece while cutting it. With a
simple setup like this, you can get a much cleaner and straighter cut than when
attempting to hold the tool in one hand and the work piece in the other.

Alternatively, you could use something like the X-Y cross-slide vise shown in
<<rotary_tool_XY>>. In this case, I've used a cross-slide vise (it can be moved in the
x and y axes) to hold the rotary tool. Once the tool and the piece to be cut are both
clamped down, you can move the vise using the crank handles to produce a straight
and clean cut. It is particularly useful for creating a clean notch in materials such
as aluminum, which is what is being done in <<rotary_tool_XY>>. Widening the notch just
requires a slight turn on one of the crank handles to shift the cutting blade over a
small amount, and the other crank is used to move the cut-off disc through the material
once more. Repeat as necessary to make a clean notch of the desired width.

I added the cross-reference in the following paragraph, to be more specific for the reader to find more information, but please see my comment in Chapter 3 about what looks like a broken section heading for the vise. If you intended that to be a heading and make that change, please change the reference here from <<clamps>> to <<vice>>.
////

A small bench vise (discussed in <<vise>>) is holding the piece of aluminum to be cut.
One downside to this setup is that there is no z-axis--in other words, no height
adjustment. If the cut-off wheel of the rotary tool needs to move up or down relative
to the work piece, then the work piece must be unclamped, adjusted, and then clamped
back down again. But since this arrangement is primarily intended to make straight cuts
through small items, it isn't really that big of an inconvenience. If being able
to move a cutting tool in three axes is a requirement, you can use something like a small milling
machine.

A small file can be used to clean up the finished notch and level out the bottom of the
cut. Since the abrasive wheel on the rotary tool wears down rather quickly, a notch made
with multiple passes will tend to have a slope at the bottom. Alternatively, you could
adjust the work piece to raise it slightly, and then repeat the cutting passes from the
high end of the bottom of the notch back towards the original starting end. Some filing
will still be necessary if you want a really clean and square cut.

If you're curious as to what the cross-slide vise looks like, <<cross-slide_vise>> shows
the model I happen to have. This is a 6-inch unit purchased from Harbor Freight for about
$80 USD, and it does a fairly good job. For use with the rotary tool, I've used C clamps to hold it down, rather than bolting it directly to the workbench. This allows it to be
moved if necessary, and it often ends up on the work table of a drill press. A handy thing
to have; it gets around in the shop.

.Vertical Milling Machines
****
Don't let the cross-slide vise tempt you into thinking that your drill press can be a
vertical mill. The bearings in most small-shop drill presses are not designed to take
the side loads that milling can generate; they're made to take a load along the axis of
the drill. Using a standard drill press as a mill with anything harder than soft plastic
will almost certainly damage it, and replacing the bearings can be an annoying task.
While there are drill presses available that are rated for use as light-duty milling
machines, they really aren't an ideal substitute for a real vertical mill.

A _vertical mill_ is a machine tool that is designed specifically to handle high side
loads, and they look something like a drill press on steroids. It has a vertically
mounted spindle to hold a cutting tool, a table that can move in X and Y like the
cross-slide vise, and usually in Z (height) as well. A vertical mill is designed to
take a lot of side force, and these tools can cut a 1/2" wide channel through a block
of aluminum without breaking a sweat.  If you don't know what a vertical mill looks
like, just do a search for "vertical mill" in Google Images.

Designed primarily to cut metal, vertical mills use special cutting tools. The cutting
tools come in a variety of styles, and they usually have a flat or blunt end without a
sharp point like a drill bit. Some vertical mills can also be used as a drill press with
conventional drill bits, albeit a rather large drill press.

If you want a small vertical mill for your shop, you might consider one of the imported
machines from China to start with. They are relatively inexpensive, but you should be
prepared to make some adjustments, and possibly even some minor modifications, to make
the tool stable and accurate enough to do any serious work. Some of the sources for
these are Harbor Freight, Enco, and Penn Tool Company. Another option is combination
tools, such as the Smithy Midas that combines a mill and lathe into a single machine.
Sherline also makes a 3-in-1 tool suitable for light work.

Lastly, there's always used equipment to consider. A number of interesting small milling
machines appeared on the market from about 1940 to around 1970. If you look around enough,
you might find an old Hardinge, Clausing, or even a Rockwell. These are heavy-duty little
machines made for regular use in a working machine shop. Consequently, they are tough and
very heavy. A special stand is required, as a typical workbench won't support the weight.

In addition to a huge number of books, both new and used, on machine shop practices, there is a lively and dynamic online community of enthusiasts,
collectors, and hobbyists to turn to with questions. There are also websites devoted almost exclusively to various brands and types of machine tools, so getting parts
and advice is usually not a problem.

[[summary_ch04]]
=== Summary

In this chapter, we've covered a variety of tool techniques. There are, of course, more types
of tools available than what we've seen here and in <<Chapter_3>>, but to do
justice to them all would require a set of books rather than a couple of chapters.
With what is here, you should be able to get a basic idea of how the various tools
are used and what can be done with them, as well as what to watch out for when using them.

We've also seen that there is nothing wrong with modifying a tool so that it will
perform better in a particular application. While it is possible to purchase sets
of precision tools for special applications already shaped to specific widths and
lengths, you can save a lot of money by doing it yourself if you are patient and
have the right tools. The "right tools" in this case means a small grinder like the
one shown in <<grinders>>, and possibly a combination belt/disc sander. A vise
also comes in handy for bending and shaping metal items, like tools, and there is
also a small anvil in my shop for times when I need to beat on something to get it
into the shape I want. (Or just when I feel like beating on something.)

An important point to take away from this chapter is that even though a tool might
seem conceptually simple, there is often more to correctly using it than you might
first think. The key is to gain experience with the various tools, research them to
acquire additional details, and talk to people who have experience with them. Or,
to summarize it another way: use the right tool for the job, and use the tool the
way it was intended to be used.

One of the best ways to learn how to use tools correctly is to practice. This is
one reason why this book mentions disassembling old electronic equipment in many
different places. Another approach is to purchase practice kits made specifically
to use as training aids. There are several sources for SMT soldering practice kits,
which usually consist of a double-sided PCB with a selection of mounting patterns
and some parts to solder. What the parts happen to be isn't relevant, just the
form factors. Try searching for "SMT practice kit" on Google to get some ideas of
what is available and the typical cost.

Lastly, consider keeping a notebook for your own discoveries and thoughts regarding
your tools and how you use them. While you probably don't need to take notes on
using a screwdriver, if you modify a screwdriver, it might be helpful to understand
why you did so later on. This would apply to any tool customization that might not
be intuitively obvious, and it definitely applies to special-purpose custom tools.((("tools", "techniques", startref ="ix_tooltechnique")))
