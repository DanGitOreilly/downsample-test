Resources
=========

** Figs: Illustrations is still working on the figs.
   527 total. (0 are informal; 4 are inline.)

   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo in Git.

** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master
  
  
Notes from Tools:
=================

** xrefstyle doesn't work yet in HTMLBOOK (to get xref output like "Chapter 1: Electrons in Motion"), so I've left the preface with xrefs that have hardcoded xref markup (something like: <<Chapter_1, Chapter 1: Electrons in Motion>>). LEAVING TO PROD to decide what to do with these.

** There are many CSS issues throughout the book. I have submitted a Stylesheet ticket: https://intranet.oreilly.com/jira/browse/STYL-138

** I converted the instances of docbook passthroughs for math equations (like seen below) to HTMLbook. Docbook passthroughs needed some handling fixes (waiting to be deployed), but HTMLbook passthroughs work just fine!

** 0 out of 5 code listing with syntax highlighting.

** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.


Notes from Dan:
==================

Ready for intake. Please move to Atlas 2, but leave as asciidoc and apply oreilly_diy2column_theme. [DONE --TOOLS]

Prod: this is the first time this theme will be used. Expect to find elements that need CSS tweaking and please report them to Ron. Look 
critically at the output and don't assume that everything is working as it should. There will be problems.

The Preface includes hard-coded crossrefs in How This Book Is Organized. [LEAVING TO PROD --TOOLS]

Please use the new boilerplate copyright text on the copyright page. [DONE --TOOLS]

The author used nonstandard markup for equations. Here's an example from Chapter 1: [SEE NOTES --TOOLS]

++++
<simplelist>
<member>E = IR</member>
</simplelist>
++++

Prod: there's a good deal of math in this book. Please watch for equations that are set in latex but are simple enough to be set with just 
text. Also watch for sentence such as the following, which include variables in plain text but that should be italic. Please ask the 
copyeditor to watch for these and to work with the author to make it clear how these terms should be set. Here's an example sentence:

Where E is voltage (in Volts), I is current (in Amperes), and R is resistance
(in Ohms).

Appendix C is a Glossary. Please apply standard formatting to the glossary terms and definitions.

Illustrations:
[from Brian Sawyer]: There are many, many illustrations that will need to be redrawn. They look good, but they'll need our house style 
and special touch. Please let the author know if you need original versions of them to help the process.


==================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,
Chris
