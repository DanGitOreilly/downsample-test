    <meta name="description" content="How much do you need to know about electronics to create something interesting, or creatively modify something that already exists? If you'd like to build an electronic device, but don't have much experience with electronics components, this hands-on workbench reference helps you find answers to technical questions quickly. Filling the gap between a beginner's primer and a formal textbook, Practical Electronics explores aspects of electronic components, techniques, and tools that you would typically learn on the job and from years of experience."/>
