== Electrons in Motion

The field of electrical theory and electronics is huge, and it can be somewhat
daunting at first. In reality, you don't need to know all the little
theoretical details to get things up and running. But to give your
efforts a better chance at success, it is a good idea to understand the basics
of what electricity is and how, in general terms, it works. So that's what we're
going to look at here.

The main intent of this chapter is twofold. First, I want to dispense with the
old "water-flowing-in-a-pipe" analogy((("electrons", "flow of", "water-flowing-in-a-pipe analogy"))) that has been used in the past to describe the
flow of electrons in a conductor; it's not very accurate and can lead to some
erroneous assumptions. There is, I believe, a better way to visualize what is
going on, but it does require a basic understanding of what an atom is and how
its component parts work to create electric charge and, ultimately, electric
current. It might sound rather like something from the realm of physics (and,
to be honest, it is, along with chemistry), but once you understand these
concepts, things like fluorescent lights, neon signs, lightning, arc welders,
plasma cutting torches, heating elements, and the electronic components you
might want to use in a project will become easier to understand. The old
water-flowing-in-a-pipe model doesn't really scale very well, nor does it
translate easily to anything other than, well, water flowing through a pipe.

Second, I'd like to build on this atom-based model to introduce some basic
concepts that will come up later as you work on your own projects. By the end
of this chapter, you should have a good idea of what the terms _voltage_, _current_,
and _power_ mean and how to calculate these values. If you need more details on a
lower level, you'll find them in <<Appendix_A>>, including overviews of serial
and parallel circuits, and basic AC circuit concepts. Of course,
numerous excellent texts are readily available on the subject, and I encourage you
to seek them out if you would like to dig deeper into the theory of electronics.

If you are already familiar with the basic concepts of electronics, feel
free to skip this chapter. Just don't forget to take advantage of <<Appendix_A>>
and the suggested references in <<Appendix_D>> if you run into a need for further
details somewhere along the line.

[[AtomsandElectrons]]
=== Atoms and Electrons

In common everyday usage, the term _electricity_ is((("electricity", "common, everyday use of the term"))) used to refer to the stuff
that one finds inside a computer, in a wall outlet, in the wires strung between
poles beside the street, or at the terminals of a battery. But just what _is_
this stuff, really?

Electricity is the physical manifestation of ((("electrons")))the movement of _electrons_, little
specks of subatomic matter that carry a negative electrical charge.((("electricity", "formal definition"))) As we know,
all matter is composed of _atoms_. ((("atoms")))Each atom has a nucleus at its core with a
net positive charge. Each atom also has one or more negative electrons bound to
it, each one whipping around the positively charged nucleus in a quantum
frenzy.

It is not uncommon to hear of the "orbit" of an electron about the nucleus, but
this isn't entirely accurate, at least not in the classical sense of the term
_orbit_. An electron doesn't orbit the nucleus of an atom in the way a planet orbits
a star or a satellite orbits the earth, but it's a close enough approximation
for our purposes.

In reality, it's more like layers of clouds wrapped around the nucleus, with the
electrons being somewhere in the layers of the cloud. One way to think of it is
as a probability cloud, with a high probability that the electron is somewhere in
a particular layer. Due to the quirks of quantum physics, we can't directly
determine where an electron is located in space at any given time without breaking
things, but we can infer where it is by indirect measurements. Yes, it's a bit
mind-numbing, so we won't delve any deeper into it here. If you want to know more
of the details, I would suggest a good modern chemistry or physics textbook, or for
a more lightweight introduction, you might want to check out the "Mr. Tompkins"
series of books by the late theoretical physicist George Gamow.

The nucleus of most atoms is made up of two basic((("protons")))((("neutrons"))) particles: _protons_ and _neutrons_,
with the exception of the hydrogen atom, which has only a single positive proton
as its nucleus.((("nucleus"))) A nucleus may have many protons, depending on what type of atom
it happens to be (iron, silicon, oxygen, etc.). Each proton has a positive
charge (called a _unit charge_).((("unit charge"))) Most atoms also have a collection of neutrons,
which have about the same mass as a proton but no charge (you might think of
them as ballast for the atom's nucleus). <<hydrogen_copper_atoms>> shows schematic
representations of a ((("atoms", "hydrogen and copper, representation of")))hydrogen atom and a copper atom.

[[hydrogen_copper_atoms]]
.Hydrogen and copper atoms
image::images/pect_0101.png["Hydrogen and copper atoms",align="center",width="300"]

The +1 unit charges of the protons in the nucleus will cancel out the â€“1 unit
charges of the electrons, and the atom will be electrically neutral, which is the
state that atoms want to be in. If an atom is missing an electron, it will have
a net positive charge, and an extra electron will give it a net negative charge.

The electrons of an atom are arranged into what are((("electrons", "orbital shells")))((("orbital shells"))) called _orbital shells_ (the
clouds mentioned earlier), with an outermost shell((("valence shell"))) called the _valence shell_.
Conventional theory states that each shell has a unique energy level and each
can hold a specific number of electrons.((("atoms", "conductive properties of")))((("conductivity", "of atoms"))) The outermost shell typically
determines the chemical and conductive properties of an atom, in terms of how
easily it can release or receive an electron. Some elements, such as metals, have
what is considered to be an "incomplete" valence shell. Incomplete, in this sense,
means that the shell contains fewer than the maximum possible number of electrons,
and the element is chemically reactive and able to exchange electrons with other
atoms. It is, of course, more complex than that, but a better definition is way
beyond the scope of this book.

For example, notice that the copper atom in <<hydrogen_copper_atoms>> has 29
electrons and one is shown outside of the main group of 28 (which would be
arranged in a set of shells around the nucleus, not shown here for clarity).
The lone outermost electron is copper's valence electron. Because the valence
shell of copper is incomplete, this electron isn't very tightly bound, so copper
doesn't put up too much of a fuss about passing it around. In other words,
copper is a relatively good conductor.

An element such as sulfur, on the other hand, has a complete outer
shell and does not willingly give up any electrons. Sulfur is rated as one of
the least conductive elements, so it's a good insulator. Silver tops the list
as the most conductive element, which explains why it's considered useful in
electronics. Copper is next, followed by gold. Still, other elements are somewhat
ambivalent about conducting electrons, but will do so under certain conditions.
These are called _semiconductors_, and((("semiconductors"))) they are the key to modern electronics.

This should be a sufficient model for our purposes, so we won't pry any further
into the inner secrets of atomic structure. What we're really interested in
here is what happens when atoms do pass electrons around, and why they would
do that to begin with.

[[ElectricCharge]]
=== Electric Charge and Current

Electricity involves two fundamental((("electricity", "electric charge"))) phenomena: electric charge
and electric current. _Electric charge_ is a basic characteristic of matter and
is the result of something having too many electrons (negative charge), or
too few electrons (positive charge) with regard to what it would otherwise
need to be electrically neutral. An atom with a negative or positive charge
is sometimes called an _ion_.((("ions")))

A basic characteristic of electric charges is that charges of the same kind
repel one another, and opposite charges attract. This is why electrons and
protons are bound together in an atom, although under most conditions they
can't directly combine with each other because of some other fundamental
characteristics of atomic particles (the exceptional cases are a certain
type of radioactive decay and inside a stellar supernova). The important
thing to remember is that a negative charge will repel electrons, and a
positive charge will attract them.

Electric charge, in and of itself, is interesting but not particularly useful
from an electronics perspective. For our purposes, really interesting things
begin to happen only when charges are moving. The movement of electrons
through a circuit of some kind is ((("electricity", "electric current or current flow")))((("current flow")))called
_electric current_, or _current flow_, and it is also what happens when the static
charge you build up walking across a carpet on a cold, dry day is transferred
to a doorknob. This is, in effect, the current (flow) moving between a high
potential (you) to a lower potential (the doorknob), much like water flows
down a waterfall or a rock falls down the side of a hill. The otherwise
uninteresting static charge suddenly becomes very interesting (or at least
it should get your attention).((("potential"))) When a charge is not in motion, it is called
the _potential_, and yes, we can make an analogy between electrical potential
and mechanical potential energy, as you'll see shortly.

Current flow arises when the atoms that make up the conductors and components
of electrical circuits transfer electrons from one to another. Electrons move
toward things that are positive, so if you have a small light bulb attached
to a battery with some((("flashlights"))) wires (sometimes also known as a _flashlight_), the
electrons move out of the negative terminal of the battery, through the light
bulb, and return back into the positive terminal. Along the way, they cause
the filament in the lamp to get white-hot and glow.

<<electrons_moving_in_a_wire>>, a simplified diagram of some copper atoms in
a wire, shows one way to visualize the current flow. When an electron is
introduced into one end of the wire, it causes the first atom to become
negatively charged. It now has too many electrons. Assuming a
continuous source of electrons, the new electron cannot exit the way it came
in, so it moves to the next available neutral atom. This atom is now negative
and has a surplus electron. In order to become neutral again (the preferred
state of an atom), it then passes an extra electron to the next (neutral)
atom, and so on, until an electron appears at the other end of the wire. So
long as there is a source of electrons under pressure connected to the wire
and a return path for the electrons back to the source, current will flow. The
pressure is ((("voltage")))called _voltage_, which <<CurrentFlow>> will discuss in more detail.

[[electrons_moving_in_a_wire]]

{empty} +

<<electrons_as_marbles_in_a_tube>> shows another way to think about current.
In this case, we have a tube (a conductor) filled end to end with marbles
(electrons).

[[electrons_as_marbles_in_a_tube]]
.Modeling electrons with marbles in a tube
image::images/pect_0103.png["Electrons like marbles in a tube",width="380",align="center"]
{empty} +

When we push a marble into one end of the tube in <<electrons_as_marbles_in_a_tube>>,
a marble falls out the opposite end. The net number of marbles in the tube
remains the same. Note that the electrons put into one end of a conductor are
not necessarily the ones that come out the other end, as you can see from Figures pass:[<a href="electrons_moving_in_a_wire">1-2</a>] and pass:[<a href="electrons_as_marbles_in_a_tube">1-3</a>]. In fact, if the conductor is long enough, the electrons introduced at one end might not be the ones that appear at the other end, but electrons would appear, and you would still be able to measure electron movement in the conductor.

[[CurrentFlow]]
=== Current Flow in a Basic Circuit

Electricity flows when a closed circuit allows for the electrons to move from
a high potential to a lower potential in a closed loop.((("circuits", "current flow in a basic circuit")))((("current flow", "in a basic circuit"))) Stated another way, current flow requires a source of electrons with a force to move them, as well as a return point for the pass:[<span class="keep-together">electrons.</span>]

Electric current flow (a physical phenomenon) is characterized by four
fundamental quantities: voltage, current, resistance, and power. We'll use
the simple circuit shown in <<simple_dc_circuit>> as our baseline for the
following discussion. Notice that the circuit is shown both in picture and
schematic form. For more about schematic symbols, refer to <<Appendix_B>>.

[[simple_dc_circuit]]
.A simple DC circuit
image::images/pect_0104.png["A simple DC circuit", width=400,align="center"]

A few words about the term _current_ are in order here.((("current", "definitions in electronics"))) The word has more than
one meaning in electronics, which can be confusing at first. In one sense,
current refers to the flow of electrons through a conductor of some kind. It
is a reference to the movement of charge carried by the electrons. In the other
sense, current refers to the number of electrons moving through the conductor.
In this sense, it specifies the volume of electrons moving past some point
in the circuit at some point in time. In other words, the measurement of current
is the determination of the quantity of electrons in motion.

One way to think about current is to remember that it cannot be measured without movement, so when you see or hear the word _current_, it is usually
referring to movement. To make the distinction clear,((("current flow", "versus current"))) the term _current flow_ is
often used to mean movement of electrical charges. Static charges, even if just
at the terminals of a common battery, have no current flow and hence no measurable
current.

Current that flows in only one direction, as in <<simple_dc_circuit>>, is called
_direct current_ (DC).((("current", "direct current (DC)")))((("direct current (DC)")))((("DC", see="direct current"))) A common battery produces DC, as does the DC power supply
in a typical computer system. Current that changes direction repeatedly is called
_alternating current_ (AC).((("current", "alternating current (AC)")))((("AC", see="alternating current")))((("alternating current (AC)"))) AC is what comes out of a household wall socket (in
the US, for example). It is also the type of current that drives the loudspeakers
in a stereo system. ((("frequency")))The rate at which the current changes direction is called the
_frequency_ and is measured in cycles per second in units of Hertz (abbreviated Hz).
So, a 60 Hz signal is made up of a current flow changing direction 60 times per
second. When AC is used to drive a loudspeaker, a signal with a
frequency of 440 Hz will be A above middle C to our ears.

By convention, DC is described as flowing from positive to ground
(negative), whereas in reality, electrons flow from the negative terminal to the
positive terminal of the power source. In <<simple_dc_circuit>>, the arrows show
the electron flow. Basically, the discrepancy stems from an erroneous assumption made by
Benjamin Franklin, who thought that electrons had a positive charge and flowed
from positive to negative terminals.((("Franklin, Benjamin"))) He guessed wrong, but we ended up with a
convention that was already well ingrained by the time physicists figured out
what was really going on. Hence we have conventional current flow and electron
current flow. Although you should be aware of this discrepancy, from this point
onward, we'll use conventional current flow, since that is what most of the
electronics industry uses.

A _volt_ (V) is the unit of((("V", see="volt")))((("volt (V)"))) measurement used for electric potential difference, electric
potential, and electromotive force.((("voltage"))) When the term _voltage_ is used, it usually refers
to the electric potential difference between two points.((("potential difference"))) In other words, we say that a
static charge has a value of some number of volts (potential), but there is a
certain amount of voltage between two points in a circuit (potential difference).

Voltage can be visualized as a type of pressure, or driving force (although it is not
actually a force in a mechanical sense). ((("electromotive force (emf)")))This is the electromotive force (emf) produced
by a battery or a generator of some type, and the emf can drive a current through a circuit.
And even though it may not look like a generator, a power supply (like the one that plugs
into the wall socket to charge a cell phone) is really nothing more than a converter for
the output of a generator at a power plant somewhere.

Another way to think of voltage is as the electric potential difference between two points
in an electric field. It is similar to the difference in the potential energy of a cannonball at the top of a ladder as opposed to one at the top of a tall tower. Both cannonballs
exist in the earth's gravitational field, they both have potential energy, and it took some
work to get them both into position. When they are released, the cannonball on the top of the
tower will have more energy when it hits the ground than the cannonball dropped from the
top of the ladder, because it had a larger potential energy due to its position.

These two descriptions of voltage are really just opposite sides of the same coin. In
order to create a potential difference between two points, work must be done. When that energy
is lost or used, there is a potential drop. When the cannonball hits the ground, all of the
energy put into getting it into position against the pull of gravity is used to make a
nice dent in the ground.

The main point here to remember is that a high voltage has more available electrical energy
(pressure) than a low voltage. This is why you don't get much more than a barely visible
spark when you short out a common 9-volt battery with a piece of((("lightning"))) wire, but lightning, at
around 10,000,000 volts (or more!), is able to arc all the way between a cloud and the
ground in a brilliant flash. The lightning has more voltage and hence a larger potential
difference, so it is able to overcome the insulating effects of the intervening air.

Whereas voltage can be viewed as electrical pressure, current is the measure of the quantity,
or volume, of electrons moving through a circuit at some given point.((("voltage", "current versus")))((("current", "voltage versus"))) Remember that the term _current_ can have two different meanings: electron movement (flow) and
the volume of the electron flow. In electronics, the word _current_ usually means
the quantity of electrons flowing through a conductor at a specific point at a single instant
in time. In this case, it refers to a physical quantity and is measured in units of((("A", see="amperes")))((("amperes (A)")))
amperes (abbreviated as A).

Now that we've looked at voltage and current, we can examine some of the things
that happen while charge is in motion (current flow) at some particular voltage.
No matter how good a conventional conductor happens to be, it will never pass
electrons without some resistance((("resistance"))) to the current flow (superconductors get
around this, but we're not going to deal with that topic here). _Resistance_ is
the measure of how much the current flow is impeded in a circuit, and it is
measured in units of((("ohms"))) ohms, named after German ((("Ohm, Georg Simon")))physicist Georg Simon Ohm. <<Resistance>>
has more details about the physical properties of resistance, but for now, let's consider how
resistance interacts with current flow.

You might think of resistance as an analog of mechanical friction (but the analogy
isn't perfect). When current flows through a resistance, some of the voltage
potential difference is converted to heat, and there will be a voltage drop across
the resistor. How much heat is generated is a function of how much current is flowing
through the resistance and the amount of the voltage drop. We'll look at this more closely
in <<Power>>.

You can also think of resistance as the degree of "stickiness" that an atom's valence
shell electrons will exhibit.((("atoms", "stickiness of valence shell electrons")))((("valence shell", "stickiness of electrons"))) Atoms that can give up or accept electrons easily will have
low resistance, whereas those that want to hold onto their electrons will exhibit higher
resistance (and, of course, those that don't readily give up electrons under normal
conditions are good insulators).

Carbon, for example, will conduct electricity, but not as easily as copper. Carbon
is a popular material for fabricating the components called resistors used in
electronic circuits. <<Chapter_8>> covers passive components, such as resistors.

[[OhmsLaw]]
=== Ohm's Law

As you may have already surmised, there is a fundamental relationship between
voltage, current, and resistance. ((("voltage", "relationship with resistance and current (Ohm&#x27;s Law)")))((("current", "relationship with voltage and resistance (Ohm&#x27;s Law)")))((("resistance", "relationships with voltage and current (Ohm&#x27;s Law)")))This is the famous ((("Ohm&#x27;s Law")))equation called _Ohm's law_.
It looks like this:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>E = IR</p>
</div>
++++

where _E_ is voltage (in volts), _I_ is current (in amperes), and _R_ is resistance (in ohms).

This simple equation is fundamental to electronics, and indeed it is often the
only equation that you really need to get things going. In <<simple_dc_circuit>>,
the circuit has only two components: a battery and a lamp. The lamp comprises
what is called the _load_ in((("load"))) the circuit, and it exhibits a resistance to current
flow. Incandescent lamps have a resistance that varies according to temperature,
but for our purposes, we'll assume that the lamp has a resistance of 2 ohms when
it is glowing brightly.

The battery is 1.5 volts, and for the purposes of this example, we'll assume that
it is capable of delivering a maximum current of 2,000((("mA (milliamps)")))((("milliamps (mA)"))) milliamps (or mA) for one
hour at its rated output voltage.((("batteries", "rated output voltage"))) This is the battery's total rated capacity,
which is usually around 2,000 mAh (milliamp-hour) for((("milliamp-hour (mAh)")))((("mAh (milliamp-hour)"))) a typical alkaline AA type
battery. A _milli_ is one-thousandth ((("milli")))of something, so 2,000 mA is the same as 2 amps
of current.

Applying Ohm's law, we can find the amount of current the lamp will draw from the battery
by solving for _I_:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>I = E/R</p>
</div>
++++

or:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>I = 1.5/2</p>
</div>
++++

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>I = 0.75 A</p>
</div>
++++

Here, the value for _I_ can also be written as 750 mA (milliamperes). If you want to
know how long the battery will((("batteries", "calculating how long a battery will last"))) last, you can divide its capacity by the current
in the circuit:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>2/0.75 = 2.67 hours (approximately)</p>
</div>
++++

[[Power]]
=== Power

In the simple ((("circuits", "power")))circuit shown in <<simple_dc_circuit>>, the flow of electrons through
the filament in the lamp causes it to heat up to the point where it glows brightly
(between 1,600 to 2,800 degrees C or so). The filament in the lamp gets hot because it
has resistance, so current flows less easily through the filament than it does through
the wires in the circuit.

_Power_ is the rate of((("power"))) doing work per unit of time, and is measured in watts. One((("watts"))) watt is
defined as the use or generation of 1 joule of energy per second. In an electrical
circuit, a watt can also be defined as 1 ampere of current moving through a resistance at
1 volt of potential, and when charges move from a high voltage to a low voltage (a potential
difference) across a resistive device, the energy in the potential is converted to some
other form, such as heat or mechanical energy.

We can calculate power (_P_) in a DC circuit by multiplying((("power", "calculating in a DC circuit"))) the voltage by the current:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>P = EI</p>
</div>
++++


In the case of the simple flashlight circuit, the power expended to force the current
through the filament is expressed as heat, and subsequently as light when the filament
gets hot enough to glow. If you want to know how much power the light bulb in our
circuit is consuming, simply multiply the voltage across the bulb by the current:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>P = 1.5 &#x00D7; 0.75</p>
</div>
++++

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>P = 1.125 watts, or 1.125W</p>
</div>
++++

Let's compare this power value with the rating for a common incandescent light bulb
with a 100W rating. An old-style 100W light bulb operating at 110 VAC (volts AC, typical
household voltage in the US) will use:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>I = PE</p>
</div>
++++

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>I = 100/110</p>
</div>
++++

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>I = 0.9A</p>
</div>
++++

Amazing! The large light bulb consumes only a bit more current than the tiny light bulb
connected to a battery! How can this be?

The difference lies in the voltage supplied to the light bulbs and their internal
resistance. Now that you have an estimate of the amount of current flowing through a
100W bulb, you could easily work out what its internal resistance might be. You should
also be able to see why leaving lights on (or using old-style light bulbs at all)
is wasteful. The current adds up, and each watt of power costs money.

[[Resistance]]
=== Resistance

Now let's look at the phenomenon of resistance more closely, since it is such
a fundamental aspect of electronics.((("resistance", "ohms"))) Formally stated, 1 ohm((("ohms"))) is equal to the
resistance between two points of a conductor when a potential of 1 volt
produces a current of 1 ampere. This is, of course, the relationship defined
by Ohm's law, discussed in <<OhmsLaw>>.

_Resistance_ is a key factor in electric circuits, which is why it is one of the
three variables in the Ohm's law equation.((("circuits", "resistance in")))((("resistance", "in a circuit"))) As stated earlier, every circuit has
some amount of resistance, except for things like exotic superconductors. Even
the wires connecting a battery to a device have some intrinsic resistance.

Switches have internal resistance, as do connectors and even the copper traces
on a printed circuit board (PCB). <<circuit_resistance_example>> illustrates
this by showing a simple DC circuit and its resistance equivalent.

You might notice in <<circuit_resistance_example>> that even the battery has
some internal resistance. <<Appendix_A>> discusses series and parallel resistances,
and how to calculate their values, but the point here is to show how nothing is
free in the world of circuits. Resistance is everywhere, as far as electrons
are concerned.

[[circuit_resistance_example]]
.Circuit resistance example
image::images/pect_0105.png["Resistance in a simple circuit", width=500]

Normally, this intrinsic resistance is ignored, as it tends to be small and
doesn't really impact the overall operation of a device. However, if the device
is a low-current one intended to run for a long time without
the battery being changed, then it starts to become something to consider. Resistance to current
flow means that energy is being expended pushing electrons through the resistive
element, and that energy is dissipated as heat. Unless you are intentionally
using a resistance as a heater (which is what electrical heating elements do),
it is being wasted.

In electronics, the passive components called _resistors_ are((("resistors"))) probably the most
commonly used parts. Resistors come in a range of values and power ratings,
from ultra-tiny little flecks for surface-mount use to huge devices used in
diesel-electric locomotives to dissipate excess energy created during dynamic
braking. <<typical_resistor>> shows a typical 1/4-watt carbon composition
resistor. See <<Chapter_8>> for more information about resistors and other
passive components.

[[typical_resistor]]
.A typical resistor
image::images/pect_0106.png["A typical small resistor", width=200, align="center"]

Resistors can be used to limit current, reduce voltages, and supply a specific
voltage at a particular location in a circuit. pass:[<span class="keep-together">Resistance</span>] plays a big role in
analytical applications such as network analysis (electrical networks, not data
networks), equivalent circuits theory, and power distribution modeling.

[[Resistor_Example]]
=== Example: Building a Voltage Divider

You can do a lot with just a power supply of some sort,((("resistors", "building a voltage divider (example)")))((("voltage", "building a voltage divider (example)"))) a couple of resistors,
and Ohm's law. For example, let's say that you wanted to supply a circuit
with 5V DC from a 9V battery. Provided that the circuit doesn't draw very
much current (perhaps a few milliamps or so), and you are not too concerned
about how stable the 5V supply will be, a simple thing called a _voltage divider_
(shown in <<simple_voltage_divider>>) will do the job.

[[simple_voltage_divider]]
.A simple voltage divider

We want the voltage at point B to be 5V when we apply 9V to point A. I've
selected resistor values that will result in 100 mA of current flowing through
both of the resistors. I've not taken into account the current consumed by
the circuit connected to point B, but since the assumption here is that it
will draw very little current, it won't have that big of an effect on the
voltage level at point B.

Notice that the two resistors in the voltage divider of <<simple_voltage_divider>>
aren't the same values. One is 40 ohms; the other is 50 ohms. If both R1 and
R2 were the same value, the voltage at point B would be 4.5V, not the 5V we want.

So how did I get those values? First, we determine the total resistance of the
divider circuit. Since we already know the input voltage and the amount of
current we want to pass through the resistors, the solution looks like this:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>R = E/I</p>
</div>
++++

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>R = 9/0.1</p>
</div>
++++

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>R = 90</p>
</div>
++++

And, since there are two resistors in the divider, the sum of their values must
be equal to the total resistance:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>R1 + R2 = 90</p>
</div>
++++

If we use the current and the target output voltage of the divider (point B),
we get the value of the second resistor, R2:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>R2 = 5/0.1</p>
</div>
++++

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>R2 = 50</p>
</div>
++++

R1 is just whatever is left over:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>R1 = 90 - R2</p>
</div>
++++

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>R = 40</p>
</div>
++++

The ratio between R1 and R2 and the resulting voltage at point B is illustrated
graphically in <<simple_voltage_divider>> by the vertical scale on the right
side of the figure.

Another way to do this doesn't require any knowledge of the current through the
divider, but instead uses the ratio of the two resistors:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>V<sub>out</sub> = V<sub>in</sub> &#x00D7; (R2/(R1 + R2))</p>
</div>
++++

Now, how long will the 9V battery last?((("batteries", "calculating how long a battery will last"))) A typical garden-variety 9V alkaline
battery has a capacity rating of about 550 mAh. We can apply the same math
used with the simple lamp circuit earlier. If we divide the battery's
capacity rating by the current consumption of the voltage divider, we get this:

++++
<div data-type="equation">
<p>550/100 = 5.5</p>
</div>
++++

So, with this circuit, the battery will last for about 5.5 hours in
continuous use.

As an exercise, calculate how much power this simple circuit will dissipate.
Since resistors are rated in terms of both resistance and power dissipation,
it should be quickly obvious that the two components will need to be rated
for around 1 watt each. This circuit would overwhelm a small 1/8 watt component.

Also, I mentioned earlier that I was assuming that whatever was connected to
the divider at point B wouldn't be drawing very much current. You could
probably increase the values of the resistors by an order of magnitude (&#x00D7; 10),
thereby reducing the total current to 10 mA, and still have enough margin
to provide a very small current at around 5V. This would increase the battery
life to 55 hours or so and significantly reduce the power rating requirement
for the resistors. When you are using a voltage divider to pass:[<span class="keep-together">produce</span>] a reference voltage
for an active component in a circuit, the current draw is often very small (perhaps
in the microamps range), since it's the voltage that matters. In cases like this,
the values of R1 and R2 can be very large to further reduce the amount of current
consumed by the divider.

This little exercise should make a few things readily apparent. First, you
really don't want to use a voltage divider to try to create the equivalent
of a power supply.((("power supplies"))) Active regulators do a much better job and don't waste lots
of energy as heat without doing any meaningful work. We will take a look at
power supplies in <<Chapter_5>> and active components like voltage regulators
in <<Chapter_9>>.

Second, with multiple variables to work with, there is a lot of room to seek
out solutions, some better than others. Don't settle on the first solution that
pops up, because there might be a better way. Lastly, batteries are great for
portability, but they really don't last long in continuous use when significant
current is involved.

=== Summary

In this chapter, we've looked at the basics of atomic structure and how that
contributes to how electrons move. We've also looked at the basic concepts
of voltage, current, power, and resistance. In the process, we discovered that
something rated for 100 watts of power at 110 volts uses only slightly more
current than something at 1.25 watts at 1.5 volts, with the voltage being a
major factor in the power difference.

With what you've seen so far, you should be able to determine how much power an
electronic device is dissipating and determine how long a battery will last in
a given situation, so long as you know the amount of current the battery is
called upon to supply.

That should be enough basic theory to get things moving along, and later chapters
will introduce additional concepts as necessary. If you really want to dig into the theoretical
end of things to gain a deeper pass:[<span class="keep-together">understanding,</span>] I would suggest one of the excellent
reference works listed in <<Appendix_D>>. Also note that <<Appendix_B>> contains
a listing of various schematic symbols commonly encountered in electronics work,
as well as a write-up on using a schematic capture tool to create neat and tidy
drawings of your circuits.
